# MIMO Best Practices

## Deployment Best Practices

- Start with 2x2 MIMO before advancing to 4x4
- Ensure proper antenna calibration
- Verify UE MIMO capability penetration
- Monitor interference impact on MIMO performance

## Optimization Best Practices

- Adjust MIMO thresholds based on traffic patterns
- Optimize antenna port configurations
- Balance between complexity and performance gains
- Regular performance assessment and tuning

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Key Performance Indicators

- MIMO throughput gains
- MIMO rank distribution
- UE MIMO capability utilization

### Alert Thresholds

- [Set appropriate alert thresholds]
- [Define escalation procedures]
- [Establish monitoring frequency]
