# Energy Efficiency Best Practices

## Deployment Best Practices

- Implement conservative sleep mode settings initially
- Ensure QoS requirements are met during energy saving
- Test during low traffic periods first
- Monitor user experience impact

## Optimization Best Practices

- Fine-tune sleep mode thresholds
- Optimize timer configurations
- Balance energy savings with performance
- Seasonal adjustments for traffic patterns

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Key Performance Indicators

- Energy consumption metrics
- Sleep mode activation rate
- QoS impact during energy saving

### Alert Thresholds

- [Set appropriate alert thresholds]
- [Define escalation procedures]
- [Establish monitoring frequency]
