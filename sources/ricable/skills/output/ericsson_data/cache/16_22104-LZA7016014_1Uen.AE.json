Because of the increased uplink MSR use, the Dynamic GBR                 Admission Control feature to reject more GBR bearers unless the Differentiation                 Threshold is raised.  The Differentiated Admission Control feature uses the lowest ARP level when                 considering resources scheduled in response to SRs with high priority.  The Prioritized SR Scheduling feature can lower the ARP blocking level in the                 Differentiated Admission Control feature. This can result in more rejections of GBR                 bearers with lower ARP level unless the Differentiation Threshold is raised.  The amount to add to the threshold to keep the same behavior depends on the SR load                 which depends on the traffic pattern.",
