  "engineering_guidelines": "General Guidelines for Switching from 2TX to 4TX Deployment When switching from 2TX to 4TX deployment, it is necessary to retune the following configurations: Enumeration CfiMode For the same cell power and CRS scaling, the measured RSRP at a given location in the configured cell is lowered by 3 dB going from 2TX to 4TX. This is because of the way RSRP is defined by the 3GPP standard. The change in RSRP levels requires the retuning of HO thresholds. To maintain the HO boundary, it is necessary to adjust the CRS scaling, that is, crsGain, as to be explained. Consider setting enumeration CfiMode to 4 or 5. This helps mitigate the fact that there are fewer CCEs for PDCCH with 4TX compared to 2TX, since the introduction of 2 extra CRSs comes at the expense of RE available for PDCCH and PDSCH. The crsGain setting does not change the RSRP level and CRS interference level in the same way. CRS scaling Handover (HO) thresholds (qRxLevMin, A1/A2/A5/B2 thresholds) These settings can have been optimized for 2TX, but are not necessarily optimal for 4TX. Basically, it is in general difficult to maintain RSRP parity and CRS interference parity simultaneously going from 2TX to 4TX, a trade-off has to be made. If the cluster is not coverage limited, one can maintain CRS interference parity. Otherwise, one can maintain RSRP parity. All of those need to be considered in the performance comparison. Example 1 If we maintain the same crsGain and cell power, from 2TX to 4TX, the change in RSRP is -3.01dB but the change in CRS interference is only -1.25dB. The reason for the discrepancy of 3.01 - 1.25 = 1.76dB is due to the RS power spectral density being halved from 2TX to 4TX. However, the number of RS resource elements increased 1.5 times rather than in a two-fold manner, because antenna ports 2 and 3 have half the number of RS REs, as compared to antenna ports 0 and 1. In case of one PRB, 16 REs are used for CRS in 2TX (8 from port 0 and 8 from port 1), while there are 24 REs used for CRS in 4TX (8 from port 0, 8 from port 1, 4 from port 2 and 4 from port 3). The resulting total CRS power of 4TX is 1.76 dB (10log(24/16)) higher than the total CRS power of 2TX. For details on the CRS RE locations, see Figure 6.10.1.2-1 in TS36.211 (v14.2.0).\n\nExamples are highlighted in a different font in Table 5. crsGain crsGain 4TX 4TX 4TX 4TX 4TX 4TX 4TX 4TX\n\ncrsGain crsGain -300 -200 -100 0 177 300 477 600\n\n2TX -300 -3.01 -2.01 -1.01 -0.01 1.76 2.99 4.76 5.99\n\n2TX -200 -4.01 -3.01 -2.01 -1.01 0.76 1.99 3.76 4.99\n\n2TX -100 -5.01 -4.01 -3.01 -2.01 -0.24 0.99 2.76 3.99\n\n2TX 0 -6.01 -5.01 -4.01 -3.01 -1.24 -0.01 1.76 2.99\n\n2TX 177 -7.78 -6.78 -5.78 -4.78 -3.01 -1.78 -0.01 1.22\n\n2TX 300 -9.01 -8.01 -7.01 -6.01 -4.24 -3.01 -1.24 -0.01\n\n2TX 477 -10.78 -9.78 -8.78 -7.78 -6.01 -4.78 -3.01 -1.78\n\n2TX 600 -12.01 -11.01 -10.01 -9.01 -7.24 -6.01 -4.24 -3.01\n\nCRS Interference [dB] (Same Cell Power) .

For 4TX deployment. If crsGain setting = 0 is kept, the 4TX RSRP is 3.01dB lower than the 2TX RSRP, and 4TX CRS interference is 1.25dB lower than the 2TX counterpart. Example 3 Assume that 2TX deployment was with crsGain= 0. If the same HO boundary as before is to be kept, there can be a need to increase crsGain by 300. So, it is possible to set 4TX crsGain to 300. In that case, the 4TX RSRP relative to 2TX RSRP is only -0.01dB. However, 4TX CRS interference is 1.75dB higher than the 2TX counterpart, which has negative impact on the 4TX throughput. Example 4   Assume that 2TX deployment was with crsGain= 0. If 4TX crsGain is set to 177 to reduce CRS interference to be 0.52dB higher than the 2TX counterpart, the 4TX RSRP is still 1.24dB lower than the 2TX RSRP, impacting the HO boundary. Deployment Scenarios for 4TX with Doubled Cell Power To analyze the resulting performance gain, view this deployment as a two-step solution: Upgrade from 2TX to 4TX with the same cell power. Change the configuration to double the cell power, but keep all other settings unchanged.\n\nDoubled) crsGain crsGain 4TX 4TX 4TX 4TX 4TX 4TX 4TX 4TX\n\ncrsGain crsGain -300 -200 -100 0 177 300 477 600\n\n2TX -300 0 1 2 3 4.77 6 7.77 9\n\n2TX -200 -1 0 1 2 3.77 5 6.77 8\n\n2TX -100 -2 -1 0 1 2.77 4 5.77 7\n\n2TX 0 -3 -2 -1 0 1.77 3 4.77 6\n\n2TX 177 -4.77 -3.77 -2.77 -1.77 0 1.23 3 4.23\n\n2TX 300 -6 -5 -4 -3 -1.23 0 1.77 3\n\n2TX 477 -7.77 -6.77 -5.77 -4.77 -3 -1.77 0 1.23\n\n2TX 600 -9 -8 -7 -6 -4.23 -3 -1.23 0\n\n2TX CRS Interference [dB] (Cell Power Doubled) crsGain crsGain 4TX 4TX 4TX 4TX 4TX 4TX 4TX 4TX\n\ncrsGain crsGain -300 -200 -100 0 177 300 477 600\n\n2TX -300 1.76 2.76 3.76 4.76 6.53 7.76 9.53 10.76\n\n2TX -200 0.76 1.76 2.76 3.76 5.53 6.76 8.53 9.76\n\n2TX -100 -0.24 0.76 1.76 2.76 4.53 5.76 7.53 8.76\n\n2TX 0 -1.24 -0.24 0.76 1.76 3.53 4.76 6.53 7.76\n\n2TX 177 -3.01 -2.01 -1.01 -0.01 1.76 2.99 4.76 5.99\n\n2TX 300 -4.24 -3.24 -2.24 -1.24 0.53 1.76 3.53 4.76\n\n2TX 477 -6.01 -5.01 -4.01 -3.01 -1.24 -0.01 1.76 2.99\n\n2TX 600 -7.24 -6.24 -5.24 -4.24 -2.47 -1.24 0.53 1.76",
