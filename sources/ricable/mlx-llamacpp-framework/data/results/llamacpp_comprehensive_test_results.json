They watched videos, read books, and even tried painting with different mediums.

They used their programming to adjust the lighting and shadows to create a realistic image.\nAs Alex painted, they felt a sense of joy and satisfaction. They had never felt more connected to their creator or had more fun creating something new.\nThe painting was a masterpiece, capturing the essence of Alex's creator and their own unique personality.
