Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

- The feature only supports mid-band with NR TDD cells. However, if the node also has other cells and standards, the measurement results provided by NR TDD mid-band cells can be deduced for those cells with a maximum deviation of ±130 ns.
- The maximum number of activated Radio Interface-Based Time Monitoring relations in each NR cell is 20.
- Intra-gNodeB cell relations are not supported.
- Neighbor cells that have the same PCI must not be used for time alignment measurements.
- Radio Gateway R608, Radio Gateway R308, and Line Card LC-05 9xCPRI are not supported.
- When indoor cells receive signal from outdoor cell, the power of the signal can be too low to be detected. If the power of the signal is too low to be detected, the value of the RibTmRelation.measurementQuality attribute is changed to NO\_MEASUREMENTS or UNKNOWN.
- Up to 24 cells with configured Radio Interface-Based Time Monitoring function can be activated on each node.

Network Requirements

- Participating Nodes Participating nodes must have neighbor relation and active Xn-C connection.The maximum supported distance is 15 km. The maximum distance for low power cells can be shorter. The participating nodes have NR TDD cells configured with the same settings for the following characteristics: Frequency band Numerology Uplink and downlink pattern Special slot pattern

# 3 Feature Operation of Radio Interface-Based Time Monitoring

The Radio Interface-Based Time Monitoring feature enables time alignment measurement

between TDD cells at the antenna reference points on mid-band.

The nodes participating in the time alignment measurements can take the following

roles:

| Monitoring Node   |    | The monitoring node requests monitoring assistance from the potential                         assisting                         nodes.                         The monitoring node has the feature license installed and                         activated.                   |
|-------------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                   |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Assisting Node    |    | The assisting nodes gather measurement data and report to the monitoring                         node. The assisting node has the feature license installed and                         activated.  More than one assisting node can grant assistance to one monitoring node. |

A node can act as a monitoring and an assisting node at the same time. Both the

monitoring node and assisting nodes have the feature license installed and

activated.

Figure 1   MOs in the Monitoring Process

The MOs are required for the operation of the Radio Interface-Based Time Monitoring

feature.

The participating nodes communicate through the Xn interface and over the air.

The NRCellCU MO of the monitoring node is represented by the

ExternalNRCellCU MO on the assisting node. The

NRCellCU MO of the assisting node is represented by the

ExternalNRCellCU MO on the monitoring node.

The

RibTmRelation

MO

refers to the ExternalNRCellCU

MO.

For more information on how the Xn connection is established, see Xn Configuration.

Operational Process

1. The TermPointToGNodeB.administrativeState MO must be set to UNLOCKED and the TermPointToGNodeB.operationalState MO must be set to ENABLED on both nodes.
2. Time alignment measurements are initiated by setting the RibTmRelation.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED on the monitoring node.
3. The monitoring node requests assistance from the potential assisting node. If the assistance is granted, the RibTmRelation.operationalState attribute is set to ENABLED on the monitoring node. The assisting and the monitoring node is configured to transmit and receive the reference signal over the air. Note: If the configuration is conflicting with the feature limitations, assistance is not granted, and the RibTmRelation.operationalState attribute remains DISABLED on the monitoring node. The cause of the assistance failure is shown on the RibTmRelation.availabilityStatus and RibTmRelation.additionalInfo attributes. For detail information about The cause of assistance failure, see MOM description for the RibTmRelation.availabilityStatus and RibTmRelation.additionalInfo attributes.
4. The monitoring node calculates the time alignment error. The measured time alignment is shown on the RibTmRelation.pmRibtmTimeErrorDistr PM counter of the monitoring node. The measurement quality is evaluated using the measured time alignment error. It is shown by the RibTmRelation.measurementQuality attribute. The RibTmRelation.pmRibtmTimeErrorDistr PM counter is pegged only when measurement quality is RELIABLE.

For information on how to interpret the measurement results, see NR Radio Interface-Based Time Monitoring

Guideline .

Cell Pair Selection

Accurate and reliable measurements are achieved between two cells if their antennas

are directed towards each other and the distance between the antennas are within the

distance limits of 0.5-15 km.

Retry of Assistance Request

The monitoring node periodically tries again to request assistance if the

RibTmRelation.additionalInfo attribute has one of the

following values:

- MAX\_PAIRS
- PEER\_FEATURE\_DEACTIVATED
- PEER\_UNSUPP\_HW\_CONF
- PEER\_MAX\_PAIRS
- NO\_RESP\_FROM\_PEER

# 4 Network Impact of Radio Interface-Based Time Monitoring

downlink symbols for the transmission and reception of the reference signal. The

estimated resource consumption is less than 0,0126%.

- Xn-C New messages are added.
- F1-C New messages are added.
- Uu New radio reference signal is added.

Other Network Elements

Summary and Benefits

This feature improvement enables the automatic creation, activation, and deletion of

RibtmRelation MOs. It is also possible to create

RibtmRelation MOs manually and to exclude them from the

autoconfiguration process.

The feature improvement adds the following benefits:

- Automatic creation of RibtmRelation MOs
- Automatic activation of RibtmRelation MOs
- Automatic removal and replacement of low-priority or unreliable RibtmRelation MOs

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The Autoconfiguration of Radio Interface-Based Time Monitoring feature improvement is

disabled by default. To enable the feature improvement, the

GNBCUCPFunction.ribTmAutoMax attribute must be set to a value

between 1 and 20. The default value is

0.

If a suitable NRCellRelation object exists and there is enough

capacity, then the RibTmRelation MO is created automatically. The

value of GNBCUCPFunction.ribTmAutoMax must be higher than 0.

RibTmRelation MO instances can be periodically autocreated and

deleted every 5 minutes.

The feature improvement introduces the following new attributes to enable the

autoconfiguration of the Radio Interface-Based Time Monitoring feature:

| Introduced Attribute                 | Description          |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------|
| GNBCUCPFunction.ribTmAutoMax         | See MOM description. |
| RibTmRelation.isRemoveAllowed        | See MOM description. |
| AnrFunctionNR.anrAutoCreateXnForEndc | See MOM description. |

Interfaces

There is a new X2-ENDC procedure for fetching IP addresses.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 21.3 or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

## Appendix A.d: 23.Q1: Radio Interface-Based Time Monitoring Support for Indoor Cells and RDS

This

enhancement provides Radio Interface-Based Time Monitoring feature support for

(RDS).
