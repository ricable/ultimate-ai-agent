# 1 Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler Overview

This feature enables higher throughput because of a trade-off between user fairness

and system performance. The cell capacity might be increased, and the feature enables

consistent cell-edge throughput.

Summary

The Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler feature allows the resource sharing of

the Baseband unit, the network, and the node between different radio bearers. This

feature provides a trade-off between user fairness and system performance. This

feature enables the network to benefit from times when the radio conditions are

different for different users.

The benefits depend on the algorithm. Compared to the Resource Fair Scheduling

algorithm, users with higher channel quality are prioritized. This enables higher

throughput and increased cell capacity.

Scheduling fairness is also provided. The average rate is considered during the

prioritization to avoid allocating few or no resources to users because of low

channel quality.

Flows with lower bit rates than the configured minimum bit rate are prioritized

before the flows that have bit rates above the configured minimum rate.

This minimum rate QoS configuration allows for consistent cell-edge throughput.

In addition, the throughput of UEs capable of carrier aggregation (CA) over UEs

without carrier aggregation can be adjusted if the CA-capable UEs have at least one

secondary cell activated for downlink data transmission.

# 3 Feature Operation of Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler

The Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler feature divides resources among users

based on a weighted measure of the monitored channel quality and average rate.

The high level flow is active except that the scheduler is enabled to make prioritization

based on the estimated channel quality and average rate. For more information about the high

level flow for scheduling, see Scheduler.

Operational Process

The Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler feature is based on the scheduler having an

overview picture of the channel quality of the users in the cell and the average rates of

the user flows. Therefore, the scheduler monitors channel quality from UE-reported CSI and

measurements performed in the RBS. The average rate of the flows is calculated based on the

previous transmissions. When resources are divided among users, the prioritization is based

on a weighted measure of the channel quality and the average rate.

Furthermore, the scheduler maintains a configured minimum bit rate of the flows. If the

average rate of a flow is lower than the configured value, the scheduler prioritizes to

assign radio resources to that flow. These flows are prioritized according to their

configured QCI priority. The flows that are above the configured minimum rate are

prioritized lower. For more information, see QoS-Aware Scheduler.

If the minimum bit rate is configured high or for too many users, or both, can affect

bearers without a minimum bit rate negatively.

It is not recommended to configure different bearers in the same cell with proportional

fair and resource fair scheduling algorithms. If the QCIs corresponding to the different

bearers are also configured to use absolute priority and have different levels of priority,

the two algorithms can be used in the same cell. For absolute priority configuration, see

QoS-Aware Scheduler.

For non-GBR QCIs, priorities are recommended to be set to the same levels of priority in

case non-zero minimum rates are used. This configuration enables fairness between non-GBR

bearers, because the absolute priority of one non-GBR bearer does not negatively affect

another non-GBR bearer.

The way resources are allocated to selected users differs between the uplink and downlink

scheduler.

| Downlink         | eNodeB  No restrictions on how much power can be allocated to one UE. | Tries to schedule as few users as possible to reduce the load on the control                   channels.  |
| Uplink           | UE                                                                    | Tries to increase the total transmission power by multiplexing more users in                   frequency. |

If frequency-selective scheduling is used in the downlink, the behavior becomes more like

the uplink behavior. The downlink scheduler tries to exploit the frequency diversity between

users so that the total spectral efficiency can be increased.

# 4 Network Impact of Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler

The algorithms available in the Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler feature affect

cell edge throughput and capacity differently.

Capacity and Performance

The Proportional Fair Medium algorithm gives optimal trade off at high load, when the

bandwith is shared between users. The high fairness settings offer more emphasis on cell

edge throughput. The low fairness variants offer more emphasis on cell capacity.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

| QciProfilePredefined.schedulingAlgorithm     | Introduced | The parameter specifies which scheduling algorithm is to be used for a certain                 QCI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| CarrierAggregationFunction.caRateAdjustCoeff | Introduced | The parameter adjusts the factor of CC rate for CA-capable UEs, which is used in                 the proportional fairness algorithm. A smaller value gives a CA-capable UE a greater                 advantage over non-CA UE. The parameter acts based on the configured value,                 according to the following:  Value 0 sets the rate as 0 and this is for testing purpose only.     Values 1 – 4 set the rate as a fraction of the cell rate in increased                       order.     Values 6 – 9 set the rate as cell rate plus rate influence from other CCs in                       increased order.     Value 10 sets the rate as aggregated rate of all CCs.     The parameter specifies which scheduling algorithm is to be used for a certain                 QCI. |

# 9 Engineering Guidelines of Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler

The operator needs to select an algorithm based on the level of fairness

preferred.

The feature allows selecting a preferred scheduling algorithm per QCI. There are five

Proportional Fair scheduling algorithms for the operator to select from:

- Equal Rate
- Proportional Fair High
- Proportional Fair Medium
- Proportional Fair Low
- Maximum C/I

If the Equal Rate scheduling algorithm is in use, the scheduler aims on providing an

equal average bit rate for the flows in the cell.

The scheduler provides a balance between the cell capacity and cell edge throughput if

the following three algorithms are used:

- Proportional Fair High
- Proportional Fair Medium
- Proportional Fair Low

The names indicate that these three algorithms are fair on different levels, high,

medium or low.

If the Maximum C/I scheduling algorithm is used, the scheduler focuses on allocating

resources to users with good channel conditions to maximize cell capacity.

The feature also includes setting a minimum bit rate for QCIs that are configured for one

of the Proportional Fair scheduling algorithms. The minimum rate for uplink and downlink

can be set independently and the operator configures them for each QCI.

By setting parameter CarrierAggregationFunction.caRateAdjustCoeff, the

rate portion used in downlink Proportional Fair algorithms can be used for adjusting

CA-capable UEs. Making adjustments can improve aggregated rates to a fraction of the

cell-based rate. The lower the value of

CarrierAggregationFunction.caRateAdjustCoeff is set, the higher

the throughput for CA-capable UEs is, compared to UEs without CA-capability.
