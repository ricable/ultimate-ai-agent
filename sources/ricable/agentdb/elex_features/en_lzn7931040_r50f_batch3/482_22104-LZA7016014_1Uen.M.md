Summary

This feature enables faster switching to higher order modulation mode compared to legacy

256-QAM Downlink feature. Faster switching improves overall downlink spectral

efficiency and downlink throughput. These benefits are achieved by enabling higher

order modulation directly at the following procedures:

- UE connection setup
- RRC reestablishment
- Incoming handover
- SCell added configuration

# 3 Feature Operation of Instant Downlink 256-QAM Activation

This feature can enable or disable 256-QAM downlink switching between legacy mode and

higher-order modulation mode.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Switching between Legacy Mode and Higher-Order Modulation Mode

If the EUtranCellFDD.instantDl256QamMode or the

EUtranCellTDD.instantDl256QamMode attribute is set to

STATIC\_HOM\_MODE or DYNAMIC\_HOM\_MODE, the UE is

configured with higher-order modulation during the following processes:

- UE connection setup
- RRC reestablishment
- Incoming handover
- SCell added configuration

Depending on the setting, the following procedures can occur after the

configuration:

- If the STATIC\_HOM\_MODE value is chosen, the SINR-triggered higher-order modulation mode switching between the legacy modulation mode and the higher-order modulation mode is disabled. In the higher-order modulation mode, the QPSK-triggered switching back to the legacy modulation mode is still enabled. The UE keeps the higher-order modulation mode until release or handover to another cell. This is true even if the SINR declines.Note: Intra-cell handover is conflicting with the STATIC\_HOM\_MODE value because in case of intra-cell handover, the UE switches back to the legacy modulation mode. In this case, the UE cannot switch to the higher-order modulation mode, even if the SINR improves. As a result, any feature that triggers intra-cell handover is conflicting with the STATIC\_HOM\_MODE value. Such features are, for example, TTI Bundling or EN-DC.
- If the DYNAMIC\_HOM\_MODE value is chosen, switching between legacy modulation mode and higher-order modulation mode is enabled. If the downlink SINR is improved, the eNodeB switches the UE configuration to higher-order modulation mode. If the SINR declines, the eNodeB switches the UE configuration to legacy modulation mode.

# 4 Network Impact of Instant Downlink 256-QAM Activation

This feature improves throughput and spectral efficiency for good coverage UE with

short burst downloads.

Capacity and Performance

This feature improves throughput of short burst downloads, and improves downlink

spectral efficiency for UE with good coverage.

For UE with bad coverage, switching between the legacy modulation mode and the

higher-order modulation mode increases. This results in the following trade-offs:

- The latency of the security mode command procedure and the following counters is slightly degraded: EUtranCellFDD.pmRlcPollRetxUl EUtranCellTDD.pmRlcPollRetxUl
- The number of RRC Connection Reconfiguration messages increases. This causes a slight degradation in VoIP quality and increases the possibility of the UE being lost. Lost UE cause degradation in related KPIs, for example, ERAB drop rate increase and throughput decrease.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
