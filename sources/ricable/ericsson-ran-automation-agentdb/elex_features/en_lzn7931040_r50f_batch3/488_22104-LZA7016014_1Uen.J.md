# 1 Optimized RRC Connection Release Control Overview

The feature supports the optimization of the RRC Connection Release

procedure.

| Access Type             | LTE                                                      |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5223                                             |
| Value Package Name:     | Spectral Efficiency                                      |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 1015                                             |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                      |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

The feature introduces a configuration for the eNodeB on cell level to define the conditions

when it can stop re-sending the RrcConnectionRelease message to the

UE. The RRC Connection Release retransmissions constitute a substantial part of the

overall retransmissions. The feature allows the configuration of the maximum number

of RLC retransmissions and maximum time of poll retransmissions. As a result, the

RLC retransmissions can be reduced to the RrcConnectionRelease

message and the eNodeB can release the radio resources faster.

The feature has the following benefits:

- Reduces the RLC retransmission times.
- Increases the downlink spectral efficiency as the freed retransmission resource can be used by other traffic.
- Reduces the DTX rate in downlink because of the number of reduced RLC retransmissions.
- Increases the number of the Scheduling Elements for each TTI as more resources are available for other traffic.

Additional Information

More information about this feature and related topics can be found in the following

documentation:

- 3GPP TS 36.331, Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification

# 2 Dependencies of Optimized RRC Connection Release Control

The Optimized RRC

Connection Release Control feature is related to other features.

Features

Table 1   Feature Dependencies

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

To fully benefit from the change, the node requires support from the ENM version 20.2 or later.

# 3 Feature Operation of Optimized RRC Connection Release Control

The feature allows the configuration of

the maximum number of RLC retransmissions and the maximum time of poll retransmissions for

the RRC Connection Release procedure on cell level.

The feature introduces the following configurations on cell level:

- Maximum number of RLC retransmissions for the RRCConnectionRelease message. When the feature is enabled, a maximum number is specified for the RLC retransmissions that can occur before the RLC threshold value is reached.
- Maximum time of poll retransmissions for the RRCConnectionRelease message. When the feature is enabled, the maximum time value is specified for the duration before a new poll is requested. The request for the new poll is sent if the UE does not send an RLC Status Report.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Optimized RRC Connection Release

Control

1. The eNodeB does not receive RLC Status Report from the UE, and starts sending the RRCConnectionRelease message.
2. If the feature license is enabled, it initiates the optimization of the RRC Connection Release procedure.
3. The feature uses the following parameters to indicate the maximum number of RLC retransmissions for the RRC Connection Release procedure: EUtranCellFDD.dlMaxRetxRrcReleaseThr EUtranCellTDD.dlMaxRetxRrcReleaseThr Note: If the license is disabled, or the parameter values are set to -1, the SignalingRadioBearer.dlMaxRetxThreshold attribute takes effect.
4. The feature uses the following parameters to indicate the maximum time of poll retransmissions for the RRC Connection Release procedure: EUtranCellFDD.tPollRetxRrcReleaseDl EUtranCellTDD.tPollRetxRrcReleaseDl Note: If the license is disabled, or the parameter values are set to -1, the SignalingRadioBearer.tPollRetransmitDl attribute takes effect.

# 4 Network Impact of Optimized RRC Connection Release Control

The feature impacts downlink spectral efficiency and the number of initiated RRC

connection re-establishment requests.

Capacity and Performance

This feature has the following impact on capacity and performance:

- Increases the downlink spectral efficiency as the freed retransmission resource can be used by other traffic.
- Affects the number of initiated RRC Connection Re-establishment requests. If the UE does not receive the RrcConnectionRelease message or only part of it, the message becomes segmented. As a result, the eNodeB does not resend the RrcConnectionRelease and the UE sends a re-establishment request.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Optimized RRC Connection Release Control

The feature introduces parameters for cell-level configuration. The feature affects

signaling radio bearer

configuration.
