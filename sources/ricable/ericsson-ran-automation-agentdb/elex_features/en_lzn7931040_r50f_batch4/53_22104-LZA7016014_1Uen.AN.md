# 1 6 Cell Support Overview

The 6 Cell Support feature offers reduced equipment cost by controlling six cells with a

single Baseband unit in one Radio Base Station. This enables cost-efficient

ways of building networks in many use cases.

| Feature Name           | 6 Cell Support                                                           |

| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 1821                                                             |
| Value Package Name     | LTE Base Package                                                         |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0400                                                             |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                      |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                      |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each radio node. |

Summary

The feature supports the following configurations:

- Single carrier
- Dual carrier
- Multicarrier
- Dual-band
- Multiband

The capacity of the Baseband unit can be fully used with six-sector single carrier

configurations.

Six-sector configurations provide increased coverage when the Maximum Cell Range feature

cannot be used because path loss and bit rate requirements limit the cell range. The

following are examples on how to increase coverage with six sectors:

- 60-degrees sectors with higher antenna gain than 120-degrees sectors
- Two three-sector sites with one centralized Baseband unit

In dual-band use cases, one node can control three sectors in each band.

# 2 Dependencies of 6 Cell Support

This feature is a prerequisite for other features enabling more than six supported

cells.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The following must be fulfilled at feature activation:

- The RBS hardware configuration and the site equipment configuration are prepared for six cells. More information can be found in Radio Node Configurations and in Configuration Files.
- Depending on RBS configuration, it is possible that some other features need to be activated, see Related Features.

# 3 Feature Operation of 6 Cell Support

This feature supports multiple carrier configurations.

Supported Configurations

The following configuration variants are supported:

- Single carrier configurations In a single carrier configuration, all sectors are configured on the same carrier frequency with the same bandwidth. Figure 1 shows a single carrier configuration with six sectors, a 6×1 configuration.
- Dual and multicarrier configurations In a dual or multicarrier configuration, there are two or more cells in each sector. The different cells in the sector use different carriers frequencies within the same frequency band and can be configured with different bandwidth. Figure 2 shows an example of a dual carrier configuration, a 3×2 configuration.
- Dual and multi band configurations Similar to multicarrier configurations but cells in different frequency bands cannot share sector. They use different SectorEquipmentFunction MOs. A dual carrier on separate bands is configured as two sets of three sectors with one cell each (3×1 + 3×1). Figure 3 shows an example of a dual band configuration, in a 3×1 + 3×1 configuration. Note: Configuration with two Radio 4449 B5 B13 in the same sector is supported only when each radio is in 2T2R high TX power (60 W) mode. Also, both radio units have to be connected to the same Baseband unit.

Figure 1   Example of a 6×1 Single Carrier Configuration

Figure 2   Example of a 3×2 Dual Carrier Configuration

Figure 3   Example of a 3×1 + 3×1 Dual Band Configuration

License Handling

More than three cells can be configured in a node without a 6 Cell Support license,

but only three cells can be unlocked.

Requests to unlock more than three cells without a license result in the Configuration Requires Feature Activation alarm on the

EUtranCellFDD MO, or on the EUtranCellTDD

MO. Additional text in the alarm indicates that a license for the 6 Cell Support

feature is missing.

Removing or deactivating the license in a node takes effect when the cells are locked

and unlocked or when the node is restarted. This means that enabled cells are not

immediately affected when the license is removed or deactivated.

Supported Bandwidth Combinations

Single and dual carrier configurations can be used with any of the available

bandwidths up to 20 MHz per carrier. However, limitations by the radio, the CPRI

connection, or the total capacity for the node still apply.

For more information, see Radio Node Configurations.

## 3.1 Examples of Radio Configurations

All supported configurations with DBB, RBB, and CPRI port configurations can be found in the

following documents:

- Radio Node Configurations and Radio Connections
- Manage Hardware Equipment

The following examples can be used either for single carrier or dual-band configurations.

Sector 1 to sector 3 is in one band and sector 4 to sector 6 is in another band in a dual

band configuration.

cascading.

PUCCH and the CFI.

# 5 Network Impact of 6 Cell Support

The feature provides increased coverage with different sector

configurations.

Capacity and Performance

The 6 Cell Support feature enables coverage of a second frequency band with three

additional sectors.

Six sector configurations provide increased coverage when the Maximum Cell Range

feature cannot be used because path loss and bit rate requirements limit the cell

range. The following are examples on how to increase coverage with six sectors:

- 60 degree sectors with higher antenna gain than 120 degrees sectors
- Two three-sector sites with one centralized Baseband

For more information regarding capacity, see Radio Node Configurations.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 6 Performance of 6 Cell Support

This feature does not have impact on KPIs, counters or events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate 6 Cell Support

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011317 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate 6 Cell Support

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011317 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
