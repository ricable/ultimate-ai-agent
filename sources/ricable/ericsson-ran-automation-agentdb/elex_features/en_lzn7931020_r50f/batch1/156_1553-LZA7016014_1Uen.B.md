# 1 Overview of Hardware Equipment

Hardware equipment is divided into Baseband and Streetmacro units, cabinet and support

system, and radio units and antenna system.

Each hardware unit is represented under the Equipment MO instances by the

following MO instances:

- AntennaUnitGroup
- BatteryUnit
- Cabinet
- CcLink
- DiLink
- EcBus
- Enclosure
- ExternalNode
- FieldReplaceableUnit
- HwGroup
- OpmUnit
- RiLink
- RiNetwork
- SupportUnit

Figure 1   Equipment MO

For more information about each individual MO, see Managed Object Model (MOM).

## 1.1 Hardware Inventory History Log

The Hardware Inventory History Log allows the tracking of hardware replacements and

reconfigurations. Reconfigurations are only detected for hardware units with a serial

number.

Hardware reconfiguration occurs when a hardware unit is moved from its current position

to another occupied position.

If a RAN Compute unit is replaced, the log is restored on the new unit.

The log contains the following information of the replaced hardware unit:

- Additional text, which contains information if a replacement or reconfiguration is performed
- Name of the MO instance representing the hardware
- Hardware product name
- Hardware product number
- Hardware product revision
- Hardware product serial number

The log is stored at rcs/saf\_log/HWInvHistoryLog.

# 2 Overview of Antenna System

Antenna system configuration comes

in

different combinations depending on

certain considerations, including the

following.factors:

- The applied functions
- The previous RAN system the configruation is implemented in
- Frequency band use

Optional

antenna equipment such as an RIU can be used when installing and configuring the antenna

system.

Table 1   Antenna Hardware and Functions

Detailed information on antenna system hardware is found in the RBS Site Products

library.

RETs can be cascaded to enable one radio unit to control the tilt of several antennas. For

more information, see Cascaded RET Support in

the

LTE RAN library. The FlexRET must be configured cascaded.

Figure 2   Example of an Antenna System with an AIR

# 3 Antenna Configuration

The antenna transmits and receives RF signals distributed through a feeder cable to the

RBS.

The types of antennas used in the LTE system are as follows:

- Directional antennas are used to cover one or several sectors from a common RBS site, where the antenna beam is directed away from the RBS tower covering a specific area.
- Omnidirectional antennas covers an area of a circle surrounding the RBS tower placed in the middle of a sector.

## 3.1 Add Antenna Unit

Before adding an antenna unit, an AntennaUnitGroup MO must be

created.

Steps

1. Create an AntennaUnit MO instance related to an AntennaUnitGroup MO. An AntennaUnit can consist of several individual antennas, represented by the AntennaSubunit MO.
2. Add an antenna element by creating an AntennaSubunit MO instance related to the AntennaUnit MO.
3. In the RfBranch MO, set the values for the AuPort MO instances. Note: If several antenna elements are related to one antenna unit, they have the same mechanical tilt. If an antenna in the AIR needs to be replaced, the whole AIR unit must be replaced. There is no maintenance button for AIR.

```

## 3.2 Delete Antenna Unit

Steps

1. Verify that the AntennaUnit MO is not referenced by any other MO instances.
2. Delete any child MO instances of the AntennaUnit MO.
3. Delete the AntennaUnit MO. If an antenna in the AIR needs to be replaced, the whole AIR unit must be replaced. There is no maintenance button for AIR.

## 3.3 Replace Antenna Unit

Prerequisites

Before replacing the physical antenna unit, VSWR supervision must be turned off and the

radio must be locked.

Steps

1. Turn off the VSWR supervision by setting the attribute vswrSupervisionActive to false in the RfPort MO related to the RfBranch MO. This MO has a connection to the AntennaUnit MO through the AuPort and AntennaSubunit MO instances.
2. Lock the radio, by changing the attribute administrativeState to 0 in the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that represents the radio. The FieldReplaceableUnit must be related to the RfPort that is connected to the antenna. Locking the radio automatically ends alarms from sectors and cells. The radio can also be locked by using the maintenance button. For more information, see Indicators, Buttons, and Switches. Note: If an antenna in the AIR unit needs to be replaced, the whole AIR unit must be replaced. There is no maintenance button on the AIR unit.
3. Remove AntennaNearUnit MO configuration including RetSubUnit in baseband.
4. Replace the antenna unit.
5. Redefine AntennaNearUnit MO configuration including RetSubUnit in baseband.
6. Unlock the unit. After the antenna unit is replaced, the state of the RfPort MO is propagated through the system to sector and cell MOs, which depend on the RfPort MO. The related MO instances are automatically enabled.

## 3.4 Lock Antenna Near Unit

Locking the unit is often part of the procedure to act on generated alarms.

Steps

1. Set the AntennaNearUnit.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED. Result: No new alarms are generated, and all alarms generated earlier by the unit cease. This does not include Transport Network modules. O&amp;M actions can be performed on the board, if the unit is still installed and included in the current configuration. The optical indicators indicate full maintenance mode. For more information, see Indicators, Buttons, and Switches.

## 3.5 Unlock Antenna Near Unit

Unlocking the unit is often part of the procedure to act on generated alarms.

Steps

1. Set the AntennaNearUnit.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.
2. Verify that the status of the AntennaNearUnit.operationalState attribute is set to ENABLED. If the unit is disabled, the AntennaNearUnit.availabilityStatus attribute contains details about the operational state.

## 3.6 Configure RF Branch

Any equipment without its own MO is merged into the RfBranch MO. This

includes

equipment such as feeders, filters, and golden feeder TMA units.

Steps

1. To configure the RF Branch, such as setting downlink attenuation and traffic delay, set the attributes in the RfBranch MO.
2. Set the rfBranchId attribute to a unique value. If an RF Branch is not to be used for TX, or an RX only radio is configured, the rfBranchId must end with the string \_NO\_TX.

For

configurations with radio supporting single band per RfPort, do the following:

3. Set the ulAttenuation and dlAttenuation or ulAttenuationPerFqRange and dlAttenuationPerFqRange attributes to a value between -500 and 500. The value range for each entry is -500 to -2, -1, 0 to 500 (this corresponds to -50 to 50 dB). Unused entries are set to -1.
4. Set the ulTrafficDelay and dlTrafficDelay or ulTrafficDelayPerFqRange and dlTrafficDelayPerFqRange attributes to a value between 0 and 800000. The value range for each entry is 0 to 800000 (this corresponds to 0 to 800000 ns). Unused entries are set to -1.

For configurations with radio supporting multiband per RfPort, do the following:

5. Configure values for the attributes ulAttenuationPerFqRange, dlAttenuationPerFqRange, ulTrafficDelayPerFqRange and dlTrafficDelayPerFqRange for the corresponding frequency range. Note: The attributes ulAttenuationPerFqRange, dlAttenuationPerFqRange, ulTrafficDelayPerFqRange and dlTrafficDelayPerFqRange are a sequence of four entries, one entry per supported band.

## 3.7 Add RF Branch

Before adding an RF Branch, an AntennaUnitGroup MO must be created.

Steps

1. Add an RF Branch by creating an RfBranch MO instance related to an AntennaUnitGroup, an AuPort, and an RfPort MO.

## 3.8 Antenna Tilt

The transmitted power in the horizontal direction is highest when the antenna beam is not

tilted down. However, tilting is sometimes necessary

to control

coverage and capacity. Interference minimization and desired beam coverage

are achieved by antenna tilting.

Figure 4   Antenna Tilt Consisting of Mechanical Tilt and Electrical

Tilt

Mechanical Tilt

Mechanical tilt is set during installation and defined as the inclination

of the antenna element axis regarding the vertical plane. Positive

values represent down-tilting, away from the vertical axis, whereas

negative values represent up-tilting.

Electrical Tilt

Electrical tilt is provided by the RET function and provides remote

electrically controlled tilting of the antenna beam. Electrical tilt

is defined by the inclination of the maximum of the antenna main beam

regarding the direction orthogonal to the antenna element axis (the

horizontal plane if the antenna axis is vertical).

Total Tilt

Total tilt is defined as the inclination of the maximum of the

antenna main beam regarding the horizontal plane. Total tilt = Mechanical tilt + Electrical tilt.

For value

descriptions and definition of maximum and minimum total tilt, see the MOM description of

theAntennaSubunit MO. To configure the maximum or minimum total tilt,

set the value in the AntennaSubunit.maxTotaltilt or

AntennaSubunit.minTotalTilt attribute.

### 3.8.1 Configure Mechanical Antenna Tilt Attribute

Changing the mechanical tilt attribute only changes the value in the system, and has no

physical impact on the antenna axis. The actual mechanical tilt is adjusted on-site, by an

operator during antenna hardware installation. One reason to set the mechanical tilt

attribute is to measure the total tilt of the antenna, is a RET is installed.

Prerequisites

Before changing the mechanical tilt attribute, the antenna has to be configured.

Steps

1. Change the mechanical tilt attribute, by setting a value in the AntennaUnit.mechanicalAntennaTilt attribute. The value represents antenna tilt that is measured relative to the vertical plane. Positive values indicate that the antenna is tiled forwards and the antenna beam is lowered. Negative values give an uplifted beam. The attribute value represents a tenth of one degree, for example, the attribute value 20 represents two degrees

### 3.8.2 Configure Electrical Antenna Tilt

Prerequisites

Connection is established to the physical antenna near unit.

Steps

1. Determine the values needed to set the electrical antenna tilt: Retrieving the existing electricalAntennaTilt value is useful, when a baseband unit is under replacement, but the antenna system, including the RET units is reused. The existing electricalAntennaTilt value is retrieved by setting the attribute value to -999, which prompts the Iuant to adjust the tilt automatically. It is also possible to enter -999 into the site equipment configuration file to fetch the electrical tilt during node installation.
    - Use the values described in Configure Mechanical Antenna Tilt Attribute.
    - Retrieve the existing electricalAntennaTilt value from a physical ARETU, and store it in the RetSubUnit.electricalAntennaTilt attribute.
2. Set the tilt value through the RetSubUnit.electricalAntennaTilt attribute. Changing the value of electrical tilt affects the totalTilt attribute of the AntennaSubUnit MO.

### 3.8.3 Configure Vertical Beam Width

Configurable Vertical Beam Width function is a licensed feature that needs to be

activated. The feature allows the vertical beam width to be set to WIDE mode that has an

impact on sector coverage.

After Vertical Beam Width (VBW) is changed from wide mode to narrow mode, RET shall

restore tilt to the last tilt value set by the Set Tilt EP. If there is no last tilt

available, RET shall set tilt to default tilt value.

Table 2

| Parameter             | Valid for   | Description                                                    |
|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| verticalBeamWidthMode | LTE         | Has the following values:    WIDE_VBW    NARROW_VBW  (DEFAULT) |

## 3.9 Configure the NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull and the NRSectorCarrier.elevationNull Attributes during the Creation of the NRSectorCarrier MO

When the NRSectorCarrier MO is created, the values of the

NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull and the

NRSectorCarrier.elevationNull attributes must be set to their

default values. To configure the values of the attributes after the

NRSectorCarrier MO is created, do the following steps:

Steps

1. Create the NRSectorCarrier MO using the default values for the NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull attribute and the NRSectorCarrier.elevationNull attribute.
2. Create the CommonBeamforming MO manually.
3. Set the value of the CommonBeamforming.coverageShape attribute to the desired value (MACRO\_1 or MACRO\_WIDE\_1).
4. Set the NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull attribute and the NRSectorCarrier.elevationNull attribute to the desired values.
5. Set the NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

# 4 AISG

The AISG standard introduces and defines features and enhancements of the management

system for ALDs, with remote control and monitoring facilities.

The AISG standard is produced by Antenna Interface Standards Group (AISG). AISG specifies

the standard interface between the RBS and the ALDs. ALDs include one or more subunits

of different subunit types such as RET, TMA, and antenna sensors. The types of subunits

supported by AISG v2.0 and v3.0 are shown in Table 3.

Table 3   Supported Subunit Types by AISG Versions

| AISG version   | RET   | TMA   | RAE   | ASD   | GLS   | ADB   |
|----------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| AISG v2.0      | x     | x     | x     | x     | x     | -     |
| AISG v3.0      | x     | x     | -     | -     | -     | x     |

The types of ALDs that are defined by AISG v3.0 are shown in Table 4.

|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Single-Antenna Line Device (SALD) | An SALD is controlled by a single RBS and it can have only one                                 control port. A SALD can have multiple AISG ports. Only one RBS can                                 establish a Layer 2 link and activate Layer 7 to a SALD. |
| Multi-Antenna Line Device (MALD)  | An MALD is able to support multiple control ports, each of which is                                 independently connected by a Layer 2 link. Each control port can                                 accept Layer 7 activation from the RBS.                |

The mixing of AISG v2.0 and AISG v3.0 devices and handling of cooperation between the

devices is supported.

### 4.5.1 Firmware of Antenna Line Devices

Firmware Download of Antenna Line Devices is a licensed feature that enables the operator to

remotely

upgrade  the

firmware of any 3GPP Iuant (AISG v2) compliant antenna near unit from ENM.

The binary firmware, needed for upgrading the antenna near unit,

is provided from the vendor in a zipped XML file. The binary is encoded

as a base64 string, so the vendor-specific content can be included

as an entry in the XML file. The XML file includes some compatibility

information that allows the node to verify that the firmware is adequate

in the unit mounted on the site. The XML files are stored by the operator

in a remote FTP server (preferably an SMRS server) at ENM.

For detailed information about the Firmware Download of Antenna

Line Devices feature, refer to Firmware Download of Antenna Line Devices.

#### 4.5.1.1 Download Software and Firmware on Antenna Near Unit

The following parameters must be set: &lt;server&gt; The IP address or hostname of the FTP server. &lt;path&gt; The file path to the software on the FTP server. &lt;userName&gt; The username used to sign in to the FTP server. &lt;password&gt; The password used to sign in to the FTP server.

Results

The Antenna Near Unit restarts automatically when the installation of the download is

complete and it runs on the new firmware when the action is completed.

### 4.5.2 Download Files on the Antenna Near Unit

The receiveLogFile and receiveInformationFile

actions retrieve a log file or information file from the Antenna Near Unit or a specific

subunit and store it at an external SFTP location.

Steps

1. Execute one of the following actions: The following parameters must be set: &lt;server&gt; The IP address or hostname of the FTP server. &lt;path&gt; The file path to the software on the FTP server. &lt;userName&gt; The username used to sign in to the FTP server. &lt;password&gt; The password used to sign in to the FTP server.
    - AntennaNearUnit.receiveInformationFile (string server, string path, string userName, string password)
    - AntennaNearUnit.receiveLogFile (string server, string path, string userName, string password)
    - RetSubUnit.receiveLogFile (string server, string path, string userName, string password)
    - TmaSubUnit.receiveLogFile (string server, string path, string userName, string password)

### 4.5.3 Upload Files to the Antenna Near Unit

AntennaNearUnit.sendConfigurationFile actions send an information

file or configuration file from an external SFTP location to an ALD.

Steps

1. Execute one of the following actions: The following parameters must be set: &lt;server&gt; The IP address or hostname of the FTP server. &lt;path&gt; The file path to the software on the FTP server. &lt;userName&gt; The username used to sign in to the FTP server. &lt;password&gt; The password used to sign in to the FTP server.
    - AntennaNearUnit.sendInformationFile (string server, string path, string userName, string password)
    - AntennaNearUnit.sendConfigurationFile (string server, string path, string userName, string password)

## 4.6 MALD Setup

The MALD setup defines the authorities of the connected primary nodes to access subunits.

It contains MALD security and MALD authority that are configured for each control port

in an XML file. The status of the MALD setup is visible through the

AntennaNearUnit.maldSetupState attribute.

The MALD security has the following security types for both software download and MALD

setup:

- NOT\_ALLOWED
- ALLOWED

The MALD authority has the following authority types:

- NO\_ACCESS
- READ\_ONLY
- READ\_WRITE

The following limitations apply in the XML file configuration:

- Only the preceding listed options can be used when users set the MALD security and authority.
- The MALD security configuration depends on the value of the ThisPrimaryIsUsing ALDport parameter. For the ALD port that is configured in the ThisPrimaryIsUsing ALDport parameter, the value of SWDownload security parameter can be changed between ALLOWED and NOT\_ALLOWED. But users are unable to change the value of the MALDSetup security parameter from ALLOWED to NOT\_ALLOWED on the port.
- Each subunit can have only one ALD port with the READ\_WRITE MALD authority. All other ALD ports must set to either READ\_ONLY or NO\_ACCESS.

### 4.6.1 Get MALD Setup

The AntennaNearUnit.maldGetSetup action is performed to read the

entire MALD setup configuration and store the data in an XML file at a chosen SFPT

location.

Steps

1. Execute the AntennaNearUnit.maldGetSetup (string server, string path, string username, EcimPasswordString password) action. The following parameters must be set: &lt;server&gt; The IP address or hostname of the FTP server. &lt;path&gt; The file path to the setup file on the FPT server, including the file extension. &lt;userName&gt; The username used to sign into the FTP server. &lt;password&gt; The password used to sign into the FTP server. Note: The progress status of this action can be tracked by the AntennaNearUnit.maldSetupState attribute.

## 4.7 AISG Device Scan

The list is saved in a file that is stored on an FTP file server, chosen by the operator.

The file can be used to detect and correct configuration errors in the antenna system,

and it makes the unique hardware ID handling easier. The file name consists of the full

RBS domain name appended with DeviceScanResult . If the full RBS

domain name is not set by the OSS, the operator can choose a different file name by

adding file name to the sftpServerPath attribute to avoid overwriting

result files from different nodes. The file name has to have an 'xml' suffix. If AISG

2.0 and AISG 3.0 device scan are both available, the results of both are included in the

same xml file.

In a Multistandard Mixed Mode configuration the output file may be incomplete for shared

radio units in the following cases:

- Antenna system equipment has already been detected by a device scan performed by another Baseband unit.
- Antenna system equipment is controlled by another Baseband unit than the one performing the device scan.

Unless a shared radio unit is restarted after performing a device scan from a specific

Baseband unit, another Baseband unit cannot configure and scan antenna system equipment

connected to the shared radio unit. In case of DUW, a radio unit restart is performed

automatically after the device scan.

### 4.7.1 Run AISG Device Scan

Steps

1. Set the following attributes: EquipmentDiscovery.portVoltage EquipmentDiscovery.sftpServerIpAddress EquipmentDiscovery.sftpServerPath EquipmentDiscovery.sftpUsername EquipmentDiscovery.sftpPassword EquipmentDiscovery.targetLdn Note: If the EquipmentDiscovery.portVoltage attribute is set to a value that the radio does not support, the VOLTAGE\_SETTING\_NOT\_SUPPORTED message appears in the service scan results for the specific radio, and the radio is ignored in the device scan procedure.
2. Select the EquipmentDiscovery.performFullAntennaDeviceScan action. The EquipmentDiscovery.performFullAntennaDeviceScan is an asynchronous action. The value of the EquipmentDiscovery.equipmentDiscoveryStatus indicates whether the device scan is finished. The EquipmentDiscovery.portVoltage attribute must be set to a value supported by the radio that is to be scanned. For more information about supported voltage, see the relevant Radio Description document in the Ericsson Radio System Hardware library collection. Note: Choosing a higher voltage than the maximum voltage capability of the antenna equipment can damage antenna equipment permanently. The radio is configured with a DC voltage value depending on port capabilities, which can be different from the value chosen by the operator. Note: A Device scan aborted message means that there are Antenna Line Devices (ALDs) that have not been detected. Note: The EquipmentDiscovery.targetLdn attribute allows the targetability of the device scan. When the targetLdn attribute is left empty, the AISG device scan procedure scans the whole node according to the chosen portConfiguration. When the targetLdn attribute is set to either radio or rfPort ldns, then only the selected MOs are scanned. If the targetLdn attribute contains both radio and rfPort ldns, then the performFullAntennaDeviceScan action is rejected with an inconsistent configuration error. When the EquipmentDiscovery.antennaDeviceScanInBackground attribute is set to TRUE the targetLdn attribute is ignored, and a full scan is executed. Note: If a targetLdn contains one or more MOs of rfPorts, then the portConfiguration attribute is ignored and only rfPorts specified in the targetLdn are scanned.

### 4.7.2 Run AISG Background Device Scan

The scan runs repeatedly in the background, providing an updated view of the

installed equipment.

Prerequisites

To detect any ALDs on a given RfPort, at least one ALD must be

configured and physically connected to that port.

Steps

1. Set the following attributes: EquipmentDiscovery.sftpServerIpAddress EquipmentDiscovery.sftpServerPath EquipmentDiscovery.sftpUsername EquipmentDiscovery.sftpPassword
2. Start the scan, by setting the EquipmentDiscovery.antennaDeviceScanInBackground attribute to TRUE. The EquipmentDiscovery.equipmentDiscoveryStatus parameter indicates whether the current scan is finished.

### 4.7.3 Run Automated Configuration of AISG Devices

Prerequisites

The automated configuration of AISG devices is executed if the AISG Device Scan

is

completed,

and

the configuration runs within the timeout provided for device

scan.

Steps

1. Set the EquipmentDiscovery.autoCreateAisgUnits attribute to true.
2. Run AISG device scan with the EquipmentDiscovery.performFullAntennaDeviceScan action.

Results

If the AISG device scan is finished, the

EquipmentDiscovery.equipmentDiscoveryStatus attribute is

automatically set to CONFIGURING. The device scan process creates

an XML file containing the details of AISG device scan results. The automated

configuration goes through the XML file and checks each discovered ALD if its

already configured based on uniqueId comparison between XML and MO.

If the unit is not yet configured, automated configuration attempts to create the MO

for it and solve dependencies.

When automated configuration finishes, it updates the value of the

The EquipmentDiscovery.targetLdn attribute allows the

targetability of the device scan. If the targetLdn attribute is

set, no dependencies will be solved when running a targeted scan.

To optimize the result of automated configuration to achieve SCANNED\_AND\_CONFIGURED,

the node should be configured with all rfPorts,

rfBranches, AntennaUnitGroups, AntennaUnits, AntennaSubUnits,

AuPorts and Transceivers created and all references between them should be set

properly.

After automated configuration finishes, the XML file created by device scan is

updated with detailed configuration results and sent to the FTP server pinpointed by

the customer.

Limitations for the creation of MO:

- The Mo creation step requires all ports under radio to be used in only one AntennaUnitGroup - failing to fulfill this limitation will cause ALD to be skipped from creation procedure. If this requirement is not fulfilled for at least one Radio Unit, automated configuration ends up with CONFIG\_PARTIAL.
- If AntennaNearUnit is an AAS embedded unit, then it is created under corresponding FieldReplaceableUnit instead.

For dependency solving between MO, if at least one of the following cases exist, the

automated configuration ends up with CONFIG\_MISSING\_DEPENDENCY:

- AISG devices connected in cascade do not serve the same Antenna.
- More than one AntennaNearUnit with SubUnit of the same type from RAE/ASD/GLS/ADB is discovered and to be configured. Note: For AISG 3.0, if the dependency for RETs in SALD/MALD is solved, the reference between AntennaNearUnit and AntennaUnit will be solved as well. And this case do not cause CONFIG\_MISSING\_DEPENDENCY.
- More than one TmaSubUnit exist.
- The dependency for RETs cannot be solved since none of the following requirements is fulfilled: AntennaSubUnits are created with Color Coding ID and there is only one match for each pair of Color Coded AntennaSubUnit and RetSubUnit. Only one free AntennaSubUnit and one discovered RET exist. The reference between AntennaNearUnit and AntennaUnit is known, and the dependency can be solved after considering only the AntennaSubUnits under the matched AntennaUnit in above requirements. RET is embedded so a reference from Transceiver is set.

# 5 Antenna Subunit Types

## 5.1 RET

The RET provides electrical tilt for tuning and optimizing the network by adjusting the

vertical lobe-angle of the antenna. The RET is implemented in both the RBS and the OSS,

so antennas connected to the RBS can be adjusted from a remote location, for example,

from an operation and maintenance center. A site visit is not required.

The RET (implemented in the ARET hardware) communicates by the Iuant protocol.

The following types of RETs exist, which need to be configured differently. (SeeRET

Support in LTE RAN library for their detailed descriptions.)

- Single-antenna RET (iuantDeviceType=1)
- Multi-antenna RET (iuantDeviceType=17)
- FlexRET (iuantDeviceType=1)

The following hardware configurations are supported:

- RET controlled by an RRU, with the RET directly connected to the RET port of the RRU (ALD Ctrl Interface)
- RET controlled by an RIU
- RET controlled by a TMA (FDD only) Note: The mRRUS does not support RET. For FDD only: RBS 6501 does not support RET. If the radio antenna does not have a RET, but the RET Support feature is enabled by the Baseband, the alarm HW Partial Fault and Current Too High might be generated.

The RIU can be installed on feeder "A" between the RU and the

antenna, or for FDD only, between the RU and the TMA.

For FDD only: if both a TMA and an RIU exist in an antenna system, the RET control is

performed by the RIU.

RETs can be cascaded to enable one RU to control the tilt of several antennas. For more

information, see Cascaded RET Support in LTE RAN library. The FlexRET must

be configured cascaded.

For detailed information about the RET, see RET Support in LTE RAN

library.

### 5.1.1 Add RET

Steps

1. Set the AntennaNearUnit.iuantDeviceType attribute based on the type of RET that is used. For more information, see RET Support.
2. Set the AntennaNearUnit.rfPortRef attribute based on the RET configuration. The value of the attribute has to match the ID of the RF Port from which the RET, TMA, or RIU is controlled and supplied with power. When more than one RET is connected, the RET units can be configured on the RF port and the RET port at the same time. When an RET is connected to the node through a TMA or an RIU, the AntennaNearUnit.rfPortRef attribute must refer to an RF Port with an ID of A, B, and so on. When an RET is connected to the RET port ALD Control Interface on the RRU, the AntennaNearUnit.rfPortRef attribute must refer to RF Port R. This RET port is modeled as an RF port that has no TX or RX capability. The MO for RfPort=R must not be added unless there is an RET attached to the RET port. For more information, see RET Support in LTE RAN library.
3. Set the AntennaNearUnit.uniqueId attribute to a unique value. This attribute is mandatory if the RET units are cascaded, or additional RET units are connected. Both the RF port and the RET port are used for RET control.
4. Create a RetSubUnit MO instance related to an AntennaNearUnit MO. Note: The RetSubUnit MO is only enabled if the RetSubUnit.retSubUnitId attribute is defined with integer numbers.
5. Ensure that the RetSubUnit MO is referenced from the AntennaSubUnit MO that the RET is connected to. The number of RetSubUnit MOs and AntennaSubUnit MOs depends on the RET type. For more information, see RET Support in LTE RAN library.
6. Set the electricalAntennaTilt attribute to the value that is specified by the customer.

If the antenna

does

not

tilt:

7. Optional: Wait two minutes and restart the radio unit, so changes to the RetSubUnit MO can take effect. Note: Only restart the radio unit if the following conditions apply: The antenna is not tilting. The RetSubUnit.TiltChangeStatusis set to IDLE. The RetSubUnit MO is not enabled.

### 5.1.2 Replace RET

Steps

1. Lock the SectorCarrier MO to prevent RF exposure from the antenna.
2. Set the AntennaNearUnit.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.

If multiple RETs are connected, or the RET is part of a cascaded configuration,

do the following:

3. Connect the new RET.
4. Scan the AntennaNearUnit.uniqueID attribute of the new RET hardware. lh ru antp devcap 128 lh ru antp devscan 128
5. Delete the AntennaNearUnit.uniqueID attribute of the RET to be replaced. In the example, it is the third RET. lh ru antp dis 128 3
6. Set the value of the AntennaNearUnit.uniqueID attribute of the new RET to the value received after the scan is performed. Note: If the RET that is suspected of being part of an AIR unit, the AIR unit must be replaced.

### 5.1.3 Actions for RET

Performing Actions with RET

AntennaNearUnit and RetSubUnit MOs must be

created and configured to perform the following actions on RET.

Table 8   RET Actions

RET Removal

The RET MO class can be deleted once all related child MO classes are deleted.

### 5.1.4 Upload Antenna Configuration File to RET

The antenna configuration file includes the limits for the maximum and minimum values that

can be handled by the antenna. It also includes data used by the RET to calculate the

movement of its motor. This is required to achieve the desired change on the antenna tilt.

Such conversions allow the operator to use units in degrees as input for the tilting

function. The configuration file is specific for the RET and antenna combination. Different

combinations require different configuration files. The configuration files are

vendor-supplied.

The configuration file also includes preventive maintenance configuration data. To prevent

a motor jam, the RET provides regular antenna motions on a weekly basis.

Prerequisites

- Before uploading the antenna configuration file, it has to be downloaded from the website of the supplier and stored in an appropriate location, for example, on an external file server that is connected to the node.
- The AntennaNearUnit and RetSubUnit MO instances must be created.
- The RetSubUnit MO must refer to the AntennaSubUnit that is tilted.

Steps

1. Execute the RetSubUnit.sendAntennaConfigurationFile action. The file path to where the antenna configuration file is located must also be stated.

## 5.2 TMA

The TMA amplifies RF signals on the receive path, before the signals are transmitted to

the RBS. The TMA increases uplink coverage by compensating for RF cable loss between the

radio unit and the antenna. The signals from the TX RBS are filtered but not amplified

before being sent to the antenna.

TMAs allow long feeders and high power amplifiers in the downlink, contributing to

balanced downlink and uplink signals.

Supported TMA configurations include golden feeder TMA and TMA with an AISG 2.0

interface.

For detailed information about the TMA features, refer to TMA Support.

Golden Feeder TMA

Golden feeder TMA is not supplied with DC from the RBS and cannot be monitored. It is

modeled in the RfBranch MO. The parameters of the TMA are set in the

feeder characteristics instead of a separate TMA unit MO, which will lead to a feeder

gain instead of a loss. For configuration

information, see Configure RF Branch.

TMA with an AISG 2.0 Interface

TMAs with an AISG 2.0 interface communicate with the RBS on the antenna feeder using the

Iuant interface protocol. These TMAs can report gain values and fault conditions to the

RBS and control RET equipment on a RS-485 interface. This TMA is power supplied by the

RBS and has the possibility to supply RET units with DC power. These devices are modeled

in the TMASubunit MO.

### 5.2.1 Add Iuant TMA

The MO representations of TMAs and antennas must have a reference between them.

TMA is optional for the passive side connectivity to the AIR.

Prerequisites

Before adding a TMA, an AntennaNearUnit MO of type TMA must be

created.

The attribute values for anuType and iuantDeviceType

have to be valid for the type of TMA that is used. When the TMA is supplied with DC power

using the RET port, the rfPortRef attribute must refer to

RfPort=R.

Steps

1. Create a TmaSubUnit MO instance related to an AntennaNearUnit MO. Note: The TmaSubUnit MO is only enabled if the TmaSubUnit.tmaSubUnitId attribute is defined with integer numbers. An RfBranch MO must refer to the TmaSubUnit MO. The AntennaNearUnit MO must refer to an RfPort MO instance that represents an antenna feeder connector on the radio unit.
2. Configure the delay and attenuation in the previously created TmaSubUnit MO by setting the following attributes: TmaSubUnit.dlAttenuation TmaSubUnit.dlTrafficDelay TmaSubUnit.ulTrafficDelay

### 5.2.2 Actions for Iuant TMA

Performing Actions with Iuant TMA

To perform the following actions, an AntennaNearUnit MO of type

TMA must be created and configured, see Add Iuant TMA.

Before replacing Iuant TMA, lock the SectorCarrierMO to prevent RF

exposure from the antenna.

When the AntennaNearUnit.administrativeState attribute is set to

LOCKED, the TMA could be replaced. After replacement, the attribute must be set to

UNLOCKED. The new TMA is detected automatically and restarted, then configured

according to the information stored in the node.

Removal

All related child MO instances must be deleted to delete the TMA itself.

### 5.2.3 Dual Band TMA Configurations

For a dual band TMA unit with four TMA subunits, one TMA subunit has to be created for

each band and branch, and the four TMA subunits must be mapped to the correct RF

branches and bands. For information about TMA subunits mapping to correct RF branch and

band and other parameters, see TMA quick guides in the  Ericsson Radio System Hardware

library collection.

For a dual band TMA unit KRY112197/x with 2+2 subunits TMA, two antenna near units handle

two TMA subunits each. A TMA subunit has to be created for each branch and each antenna

near unit, and the subunit must be mapped to the correct RF branches and bands. For

information about TMA subunits and other parameters,see TMA quick guides in the Ericsson

Radio System Hardware library collection.

#### 5.2.3.1 Configure One Common Baseband Unit on Both Bands for Four Subunits TMA

This procedure contains an example to

configure one common Baseband unit with a dual Band TMA B1 and B3 with four TMA

subunits.

Figure 7   Sample Configuration of a Common Baseband Unit on Both Bands for Four TMA

Subunits

Steps

To add TmaSubUnit MO instances, do the following:

1. Create an Equipment, an AntennaUnitGroup, and an AntennaNearUnit MO instance.
2. Create four TmaSubUnit MO instances. Example Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaNearUnit=DB\_TMA-1, TmaSubUnit=1; Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaNearUnit=DB\_TMA-1, TmaSubUnit=2; Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaNearUnit=DB\_TMA-1, TmaSubUnit=3; Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaNearUnit=DB\_TMA-1, TmaSubUnit=4;
3. Configure the four TmaSubUnit MO instances to the appropriate RfBranch MO. Note: Two physical RF branches are logically represented in each band. Because of this, a total of four RfBranch MO instances exist. If one or more attributes have automatically assigned values, then overwrite the automatically assigned values with the appropriate value manually. Example Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaSubUnit=B3, RfBranch=A1, tmaRef Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaNearUnit=DB\_TMA-1, TmaSubUnit=1; Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaSubUnit=B3, RfBranch=B1, tmaRef Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaNearUnit=DB\_TMA-1, TmaSubUnit=2; Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaSubUnit=B1, RfBranch=A2, tmaRef Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaNearUnit=DB\_TMA-1, TmaSubUnit=3; Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaSubUnit=B1, RfBranch=B2, tmaRef Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaNearUnit=DB\_TMA-1, TmaSubUnit=4;
4. Configure the dlAttenuation, dlTrafficDelay, and ulTrafficDelay attributes of the TmaSubUnit MO instances. Example Equipment=1,AntennaUnitGroup=1,AntennaNearUnit=DB\_TMA-1,TmaSubUnit=1 dlAttenuation=5 dlTrafficDelay=337 ulTrafficDelay=382; Equipment=1,AntennaUnitGroup=1,AntennaNearUnit=DB\_TMA-1,TmaSubUnit=2 dlAttenuation=5 dlTrafficDelay=337 ulTrafficDelay=382; Equipment=1,AntennaUnitGroup=1,AntennaNearUnit=DB\_TMA-1,TmaSubUnit=3 dlAttenuation=4 dlTrafficDelay=153 ulTrafficDelay=489; Equipment=1,AntennaUnitGroup=1,AntennaNearUnit=DB\_TMA-1,TmaSubUnit=4 dlAttenuation=4 dlTrafficDelay=153 ulTrafficDelay=489;
5. Configure the AuPort MO to the RfBranch MO. Example Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, RfBranch=A1, auPortRef Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaUnit=1, AntennaSubUnit=B3, AuPort=1 Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, RfBranch=B1, auPortRef Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaUnit=1, AntennaSubUnit=B3, AuPort=2; Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, RfBranch=A2, auPortRef Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaUnit=1, AntennaSubUnit=B1, AuPort=1; Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, RfBranch=B2, auPortRef Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaUnit=1, AntennaSubUnit=B1, AuPort=2;
6. Configure the RfPort MO to the RfBranch MO. Example Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaSubUnit=B3, RfBranch=A1, rfPortRef Equipment=1, FieldReplaceableUnit=RUS-1\_B3, rfPort=A; Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaSubUnit=B3, RfBranch=B1, rfPortRef Equipment=1, FieldReplaceableUnit=RUS-1\_B3, rfPort=B; Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaSubUnit=B1, RfBranch=A2, rfPortRef Equipment=1, FieldReplaceableUnit=RUS-1\_B1, rfPort=A; Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaSubUnit=B1, RfBranch=B2, rfPortRef Equipment=1, FieldReplaceableUnit=RUS-1\_B1, rfPort=B;
7. To configure the AntennaNearUnit MO to the RfPort MO. Example Equipment=1,AntennaUnitGroup=1,AntennaNearUnit=DB\_TMA-1 rfPortRef Equipment=1,FieldReplaceableUnit=RUS-1\_B3,rfPort=A

To add RetSubUnit MO instances, do the following:

8. Create an Equipment, an AntennaUnitGroup, and an AntennaNearUnit MO.
9. Create the RetSubUnit MO instances. Example Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaNearUnit=RET-1, RetSubUnit=1;
10. Configure the AntennaSubUnit MO to the RetSubUnit MO. Example Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaUnit=1, AntennaSubUnit=1, RetSubUnitRef Equipment=1, AntennaUnitGroup=1, AntennaNearUnit=RET-1, RetSubUnit=1

# 6 Antenna System Supervision

The antenna system can be supervised either by Voltage Standing

Wave Ratio (VSWR) supervision, antenna near unit power consumption,

or reflected power measurement.

The VSWR is used to measure the ratio between the reflected power from the antenna and the

forwarded power to the antenna. When the ratio exceeds a defined sensitivity value, a fault is

reported per antenna branch. To detect and report an antenna return loss fault on an antenna

branch, at least one transmission carrier must be enabled on the designated antenna

branch.

When supervising through the antenna near unit power consumption,

an alarm is triggered and the radio unit turns off the antenna near

unit whenever the current acts outside the expected power range.

The reflected power is measured with a reflected power detector,

and when the measured value exceeds a pre-defined limit an alarm is

generated.

## 6.1 Activate Antenna Supervision

Steps

1. Set the RfPort.antennaSupervisionActive attribute to TRUE.

## 6.2 Deactivate Antenna Supervision

Steps

1. Set the RfPort.antennaSupervisionActive attribute to FALSE.

## 6.3 Antenna Return Loss Frequency Sweep

With the antenna return loss frequency sweep function, the measurement of return loss

value is processed by the radio unit over all of the activated carrier branches. This is

a complementary solution to existing return loss measurement. The function identifies

the discontinuity of the RF signal between the radio and the antenna over the used

bandwidth. With this measurement, potential problems with the antenna system can be

detected without the need for advanced measuring equipment. Antenna return loss

frequency sweep function also enables the possibility to execute VSWR antenna system

tests.

The following conditions must be considered to use the function:

- Operable radio node, where at least one carrier is enabled for the designated RF branch. If a cell is locked or a carrier is disabled during a test, related RF branches might not be tested.
- Return loss is measured over the allocated frequency range by using ordinary traffic. For NR and LTE, dummy load is used for better accuracy.
- For ESS configurations, both the NR and the LTE cell must be unlocked.

The antenna return loss frequency sweep function has the following benefits:

- Antenna system validation with site visits that result in changes to the antenna system. This is applicable to the following example cases: Site deployment and installation Replacement of the radio unit Maintenance of the antenna system
- Antenna system validation during installation using VSWR installation check for early detection and fast resolution of installation problems. This enhancement is valid on the following levels: Node: all connected RF ports on the node are tested Radio: all connected RF ports on the radio units specified by the RfVswrInstallationCheck.targetLDN parameter are tested RF port: all RF ports specified by the RfVswrInstallationCheck.targetLDN parameter are tested
- Enhanced fault indication with troubleshooting support if the VSWR Over Threshold alarm is raised. For example, when the RF path is affected by one or more reflection points, or when there is strong external continuous wave interference.
- VSWR installation check can also be used to validate any VSWR supervision alarms that are raised.Note: The VSWR installation check result of one RF port might not be consistent with the supervision alarm status due to the different measurement methods and different threshold values for installation and supervision.

This function is enabled by the RfPort.startRlFreqSweep MO action.

To perform the installation check, the RfVswrInstallationCheck MO

class needs to be created manually.

### 6.3.1 Perform VSWR Installation Check

Steps

1. Create the RfVswrInstallationCheck MO.
2. Verify that no return loss frequency sweep action is ongoing.
3. Verify that there are enabled cells configured on RF ports.
4. Set and verify the input parameters for the RfVswrInstallationCheck.performCheck action, depending on the test execution level. The level of antenna system verification is determined by the RfVswrInstallationCheck.testLevel parameter. Test results are determined by theRfVswrInstallationCheck.thresholdLow and RfVswrInstallationCheck.thresholdHigh parameters. The test levels are the following: 0 (NODE): all connected RF ports on the node are tested 1 (RADIO): all connected RF ports on the radio units specified by the RfVswrInstallationCheck.targetLDN parameter are tested 2 (RFPORT): all RF ports specified by the RfVswrInstallationCheck.targetLDN parameter are tested Note: The RfVswrInstallationCheck.targetLDN parameter contains an array of LDNs that identify which radio units and RF ports must be tested. This parameter is taken into account only if the RfVswrInstallationCheck.testLevel parameter is set to RADIO or RFPORT. If the selected test level specifies more than one RF port to check, and the test fails for any of the RF ports, the tests continue for the other ports.
5. Perform the RfVswrInstallationCheck.performCheck action.
6. Check the RfVswrInstallationCheck.rfPortTestResult attribute. For each tested RF port, the corresponding test result is stored as a TestResultOfVswr struct.

If the value of the testResult struct member of the

TestResultOfVswr struct is

NOT\_TESTED, do the following:

7. Check the reasonForNotTested struct member of the TestResultOfVswr struct to determine the reason of the failed installation check.
8. Delete the RfVswrInstallationCheck MO class if the installation check is finished.

Interpretation of Return Loss value, measured by Antenna Return Loss Frequency Sweep

function.

| Return Loss Values                                      | Probable Cause                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High and stable                                         | Antenna system works well with one dominant reflection point.                                                                                                                                                                       |

# 8 Configuration Examples

## 8.1 Configuration Flow

The configuration flow consists of creating the following files:

- A configuration template file that can be reused for multiple nodes
- A site-specific configuration file, which is created by populating the template file with site-specific parameters

Template files can be created in one of the following ways:

- Using the Configuration Generator for automatic template creation with the ECT or a plug-in in the Auto Provisioning application of the ENM.
- Creating new XML NETCONF files.

The preferred procedure is to use the Configuration Generator. Only edit the template file

with an XML editor if the required configuration is not supported by the tool.

When the preferred configuration procedure is used, it is not necessary to understand the MO

structure. However, for maintenance and troubleshooting, the MO structure must be

understood.

For more information on configuration methods, see Manage Equipment Configuration Tool. For more information on

configuration files, see Manage Configuration Files.

## 8.2 Additional Configurations

Site Equipment Example Files

Additional configuration that is not generated with the basic configuration method

can be implemented from site equipment example files. This section includes

configuration that is only available in site equipment example files.

## 8.3 Configuring Radio Units and Antenna System with the Basic Configuration Method

The basic configuration method uses RBBs and ABBs as input parameters, as specified in

Building Blocks. The ECT generates a NETCONF configuration

file with the required MO elements based on input parameters provided through GUI.

## 8.4 Configuration for 4TX/4RX Radios in Combination with Four-Port Antenna Units

To ensure that the antennas are correctly connected to the antenna ports and have a

stable polarization pattern for common channel beamforming, the following connections

must be aligned with each other:

- The physical cabling, that connects the following ports: The external antenna ports on the antenna unit. These ports are defined in the corresponding AuPort MO instances. The antenna feeder ports on the radio. These ports are defined in the corresponding RfPort MO instances.
- The physical and virtual connection between the cell and the RBS equipment

The order of the RfBranch MO references under the

SectorEquipmentFunction MO must be configured to ensure that the

connection between the RAN Compute unit ports and the antenna external ports is aligned

with the chosen physical cabling pattern. This can be configured through the

corresponding RfBranch.rfPortRef and

SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attributes.

The physical cabling patterns can be, for example, one of the following ABBs:

- ABB4\_1A Figure 13 ABB4\_1A Cabling Pattern
- ABB4\_1B Figure 14 ABB4\_1B Cabling Pattern
- ABB4\_2A Figure 15 ABB4\_2A Cabling Pattern
- ABB4\_2B Figure 16 ABB4\_2B Cabling Pattern

These ABBs support both 4TX/4RX and 2 × 2TX/2RX operations. The 2 × 2TX/2RX

operation is supported because of increased virtual IBW.

Regardless of the chosen cabling, the first two RfBranch MO references

must correspond to the AuPort MOs with one polarization in a

left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit. The last two

RfBranch MO references must correspond to the

AuPort MOs with the other polarization, also in a left-to-right

order.

The physical cabling for connecting the 4TX/4RX radios with four-port antenna units must

be aligned with the MO configurations to have the proper antenna polarization

pattern.

For ABB4\_1A and ABB4\_2A cabling pattern, the following rules apply:

- RfPort=A and RfPort=C, in that order, must be connected to one polarization in a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit.
- RfPort=B and RfPort=D, in that order, must be connected to the other polarization in a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit.

For ABB4\_1B and ABB4\_2B cabling pattern, the following rules apply:

- RfPort=A and RfPort=B, in that order, must be connected to one polarization in a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit.
- RfPort=C and RfPort=D, in that order, must be connected to the other polarization in a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit.

- The physical cabling, that connects the following ports: The external antenna ports on the antenna unit. These ports are defined in the corresponding AuPort MO instances. The antenna feeder ports on the radio. These ports are defined in the corresponding RfPort MO instances.
- The physical and virtual connection between the cell and the RBS equipment

The order of the RfBranch MO references under the

SectorEquipmentFunction MO must be configured to ensure that the

connection between the RAN Compute unit ports and the antenna external ports is aligned

with the chosen physical cabling pattern. This can be configured through the

corresponding RfBranch.rfPortRef and

SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attributes.

The physical cabling patterns can be, for example, one of the following ABBs:

- ABB8\_1A Figure 17 ABB8\_1A Cabling Pattern
- ABB8\_1B Figure 18 ABB8\_1B Cabling Pattern
- ABB8\_2A Figure 19 ABB8\_2A Cabling Pattern
- ABB8\_2B Figure 20 ABB8\_2B Cabling Pattern

These ABBs support both 8TX/8RX and 2 × 4TX/4RX operations. The 2 × 4TX/4RX

operation is supported because of increased virtual IBW.

Regardless of the chosen cabling, the first four RfBranch MO

references must correspond to the AuPort MOs with one polarization in

a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit. The last four

RfBranch MO references must correspond to the

AuPort MOs with the other polarization, also in a left-to-right

order.

The physical cabling for connecting the 8TX/8RX radios with eight-port antenna units must

be aligned with the MO configurations to have the proper antenna polarization

pattern.

For ABB8\_1A and ABB8\_2A cabling pattern, the following rules apply:

- RfPort=A, RfPort=B, RfPort=E, and RfPort=F, in that order, must be connected to one polarization in a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit.
- RfPort=C, RfPort=D, RfPort=G, and RfPort=H, in that order, must be connected to one polarization in a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit.

For ABB8\_1B and ABB8\_2B cabling pattern, the following rules apply:

- RfPort=A to RfPort=D, in that order, must be connected to one polarization in a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit.
- RfPort=E to RfPort=H, in that order, must be connected to the other polarization in a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit.

## 8.6 Configuration Examples for 1TX/1RX and 1TX/2RX Radio Units

Sector equipment functions are used to configure the system by involving the used

RfBranches MOs in the SectorEquipmentFunction

MO. One or two RfBranch MOs are added if the

RfPort MO of the RfBranch MO is capable of TX

and RX.

In case of 1TX/1RX and 1TX/2RX solutions, multiple RfBranch MOs are

added, for one TX capability port.

1TX/1RX Setup on 2TX/2RX Radio

The SectorEquipmentFunction MO is created from the configuration

to follow the different coverage.

Figure 21   1TX/1RX Sector Equipment Function on 2TX/2RX Radio

When antenna units cover different areas, the following alternatives are

supported:

- Configuring one SectorEquipmentFunction parent MO that has one RfBranch child MO
- On multi-sector per radio, configuring the SectorEquipmentFunction=1 and SectorEquipmentFunction=2 MOs

1TX/1RX Setup on 2TX/4RX Radio

Figure 22   1TX/1RX Sector Equipment Function on 2TX/4RX Radio

1TX/1RX Setup on 4TX/4RX Radio

Figure 23   1TX/1RX Sector Equipment Function on 4TX/4RX Radio

1TX/2RX Setup on 2TX/2RX Radio

The SectorEquipmentFunction MO can be configured with two

RfBranch child MOs, where each RfBranch MO

refers to one RfPort MO on the radio unit. If one of the

RfBranch MOs is named

&lt;name&gt;\_NO\_TX, the TX direction on that

port is disabled. The system allocates RX direction to that port, and 1TX/2RX is

configured.
