# 1 Advanced Differentiation for Resource Fair Scheduling Overview

The Advanced Differentiation for Resource Fair Scheduling feature enables the control

of scheduling opportunities by configuring relative proportions.

|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4415                                                                |

| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                         |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                         |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								radio. |

Summary

The feature allows for the controlling of the number of scheduling opportunities for

each bearer. This is controlled by configuring relative proportions for services

using a specific QCI. The feature provides the specified scheduling opportunity

ratio between two bearers created by two resource fair QCIs.

The ratio of the number of scheduling opportunities translates to similar throughput

ratio only in the following conditions:

- The full buffer traffic model is used.
- The measured UEs have similar radio conditions.

Example 1

If UE 1 has a relative priority of 2 and UE 2 has a relative priority of 3, the

following ratios apply:

- UE 1 gets two thirds times the number of scheduling opportunities of UE 2.
- UE 2 gets three halves times the number of scheduling opportunities of UE 1.

# 3 Feature Operation of Advanced Differentiation for Resource Fair Scheduling

When the Advanced Differentiation for Resource Fair Scheduling feature is enabled, some

conditions must be fulfilled to achieve the expected throughput ratios.

To achieve the expected throughput ratios, the following conditions must be fulfilled:

- All UEs must have the same radio frequency conditions. For example, the same SINR, CQI, and Rank Indicator values.
- The bit rate received at the eNodeB for a bearer must be higher than the rate expected for that bearer.
- The cell must be congested. That is, the PRB use must be at around 90%.
- The maximum value for the QciProfileOperatorDefined.relativePriority attribute is recommended to be less than 600.

## 3.1 Downlink Advanced Differentiation for Resource Fair Scheduling

The relative priority of a bearer is determined by QCI relative

priority of the associated QCI.

QCIs are grouped into a resource fair relative priority group. For a QCI to be part of a

relative priority group, the following is required:

Steps

1. QCIs are configured with Resource Fair Scheduling and a Relative Priority.
2. QCIs are configured with either of the following: APO is set to no override, in this case all QCIs use the default priority level for user data. All QCIs use the same priority and APO is set to override. In this case, all QCIs use the configured priority level. Note: Configuring multiple groups is possible but only one group is supported.

# 5 Parameters of Advanced Differentiation for Resource Fair Scheduling

# 7 Activate Advanced Differentiation for Resource Fair Scheduling

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- The QoS-Aware Scheduler feature license must be active.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011967 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Advanced Differentiation for Resource Fair Scheduling

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011967 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Advanced Differentiation for Resource Fair Scheduling

This section provides configuration recommendations for the feature.

## 9.1 Mixing Proportional Fair Scheduling and Resource Fair Scheduling

Resource Fair Scheduling and Proportional Fair Scheduling are not recommended to mix at the

same priority level. When both algorithms are configured, the priority level must differ.

Example 2    If QCI 9 has resource fair with priority 9, and QCI 8 has Proportional Fair

Scheduling with priority 8, the Absolute Priority Override field must be set to "override" for

the two algorithms to use different priority levels. In this specific example, setting just

one of the QCIs APO to "override" would be sufficient.

## 9.2 Impact of Configuration Changes

QCI table changes do not take effect immediately. When a QCI table entry is changed for a

specific QCI, the changes take effect for new bearers created after the change and for the QCI

table entry.

## 9.3 Uplink Direction Unsupported

The Advanced Differentiation for Resource Fair Scheduling feature implements the downlink

direction only. Having this feature in only one direction has an impact on the way resources

are distributed between the two directions. Downlink direction tends to get a higher

proportion than uplink after enabling this feature. The resource imbalance impacts in the

following ways:

- The downlink direction gets higher scheduling weights than uplink and is scheduled more often.
- Given that the PDCCH resources are shared between uplink and downlink, the downlink direction gets a higher share of the resources as a result of being scheduled more often.

Table 4   Example of How to Configure RPS for Resource Fair

|   QCI Number |   Priority Configured | Priority Used    | APO         | Scheduling Algorithm   |   Relative Priority |
|--------------|-----------------------|------------------|-------------|------------------------|---------------------|
|            7 |                     7 | Default priority | No-override | Resource fair          |                 600 |
|            8 |                     8 | Default priority | No-override | Resource fair          |                 400 |
|            9 |                     9 | Default priority | No-override | Resource fair          |                 200 |

Figure 1   Weight Functions for Resource Fair with and without RPS

There are the following effects on the downlink direction:

- A QCI 7 downlink packet waits ¼ the time as a downlink QCI 9 packet waits.
- A QCI 7 downlink packet waits ¼ the time a an uplink packet waits (from QCI 7, 8, or 9).
- A QCI 8 downlink packet waits ½ the time as a downlink QCI 9 packet waits.
- A QCI 8 downlink packet waits ½ the time as an uplink packet waits (from QCI 7, 8, or 9).
- A QCI 9 downlink packet waits the same amount of time as an uplink packet waits (from QCI 7, 8, or 9).

There are the following effects on the uplink direction:

- An uplink packet, from QCI 7, 8, or 9, waits four times the amount of time as a QCI 7 downlink packet waits
- An uplink packet, from QCI 7, 8, or 9, waits two times the amount of time as a QCI 8 downlink packet waits
- An uplink packet, from QCI 7, 8, or 9, waits the same amount of time as a QCI 9 downlink packet waits
