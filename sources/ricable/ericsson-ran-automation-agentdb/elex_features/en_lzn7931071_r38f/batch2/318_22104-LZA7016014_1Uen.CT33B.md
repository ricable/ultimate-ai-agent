Summary

The feature is used for the efficient inspection of transport network issues,

significantly reducing troubleshooting time and operating expenses. The feature does

not replace existing troubleshooting features, methods, and tools. It is meant to be

used if all other troubleshooting options are exhausted.

The feature captures L3 packets or L2 frames and stores them in an encrypted

file.

Additional Information

For more information on filter syntax rules, see Miscellaneous Information Manual.

# 2 Dependencies of Packet Capture

The feature has L3 packet and L2 frame capturing limitations, IP limitations, and

requires AES-256 encryption support.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The feature has the following L3 interface-level packet capturing or L2 port-level

frame capturing limitations:

- 16,000 packets or frames can be captured in each pcap file.
- Capturing stops once the file reaches the maximum size.
- The feature does not guarantee that consecutive packets are captured on the interface or that consecutive frames are captured on the port.
- L3 interface-level packet capturing and L2 port-level frame capturing only captures Transport Network backhaul traffic.

When filtering is enabled, the following limitations apply:

- Only packets matching the configured filter requirements are saved, counting toward the limit of 16,000 packets.
- The filter string can be maximum 3950 characters long.
- A backslash (\) in the filter string must be escaped by another backslash. Example: "ip proto \\sctp"
- The maximum capture timeout value is 24 hours.
- The "proto [expr:size]" and "proto [expr]" filter expressions are not supported.
- The IpsecTunnel and the PeerIpsecTunnel packets cannot be filtered.
- If the filter string contains two or more words, it must be enclosed in quotation marks.

The feature does not support the following interfaces:

- InterfaceIPv4 without AddressIPv4.
- InterfaceIPv6 without AddressIPv6.
- InterfaceIPv4 configured as loopback.
- InterfaceIPv6 configured as loopback.
- EthernetPort MOs with encapsulation to the RiPort MO instance.
- VlanPort MOs with encapsulation to the RiPort MO instance.
- VlanPort MOs over the EthernetPort MO instance with encapsulation to the RiPort MO instance.
- VlanPort MOs reserved by the following MOs: ENodeBFunction ExternalENodeBFunction GNBDUFunction ExternalGNodeBFunction ExtGNBDUPartnerFunction

Network Requirements

The AES-256 algorithm is used to encrypt thePacketCaptureLog

file. The 256-CTR mode must be installed on the remote server for AES to decrypt the

PacketCaptureLog file. The 256-CTR mode is supported by

OpenSSL v1.0.1 or higher.

# 3 Feature Operation of Packet Capture

The feature provides an inspection tool for network issues if other troubleshooting

options are exhausted.

L3 interface-level packet capturing can be initiated on the following MOs:

- InterfaceIPv4
- InterfaceIPv6
- IpsecTunnel
- PeerIpsecTunnel

L2 port-level frame capturing can be initiated on the following MOs:

- EthernetPort
- VlanPort

L3 packets or L2 frames are captured at the egress or at the ingress flow. The

PacketCaptureLog file is stored in pcap.aes file format in a

temporary file system. The file is encrypted, and it can be exported to a remote server

for detailed analysis. The file can be analyzed with Wireshark® and

other networking tools.

Figure 1 shows the operation of

the feature.

Figure 1   Packet Capture Feature Overview

The feature introduces the following roles for configuration:

## 3.1 Safe Shutdown of Ongoing L3 Interface-Level Packet Capture or L2 Port-Level Frame Capture

If certain configuration changes are made to the target of an ongoing L3

interface-level packet capture or L2 port-level frame capture, the feature safely shuts down

the ongoing packet or frame capturing.

The ongoing L3 interface-level packet capture or L2 port-level frame capture is safely

shut down because of the following MO configurations:

- Changes to the reservedBy attribute of the target MO through configuration changes to other MOs, as the applicable MO reference can impact the target MO as well.
- Any configuration changes are performed directly on the MO on which the L3 interface-level packet capture or L2 port-level frame capture is enabled.Note: The following MO configurations do not affect the ongoing L2 interface-level packet capture or L2 port-level frame capture: Changes to the administrativeState attribute of the target MO. Changes to the underlying encapsulation of the LagPort MO, such as adding or removing members of the LagPort MO.

# 4 Network Impact of Packet Capture

The feature has server configuration requirements for OSS and ENM upgrade.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

LDAP server configuration is required during OSS and ENM upgrade.

## 4.1 Privacy Implications of Packet Capture

This feature allows manual remote packet capturing at an interface level. It is used for

troubleshooting of networking and protocol problems and is meant to be used when all

other troubleshooting options are exhausted. IP packets are captured at either the

egress or at the ingress flow, or both. The PacketCaptureLog file is stored in pcap.aes

file format in a temporary file system. The file is encrypted and it can be exported to

a remote server for detailed analysis. The file can be analyzed with Wireshark and other

networking tools. This feature can be used both by Ericsson and operator personnel but

only users with the role Transport\_Application\_SecurityAdministrator can access privacy

related data.

For more information, see Feature Description Packet Capture.

# 5 Parameters of Packet Capture

actions.

## 9.1 Use Packet Capture

Prerequisites

- The FeatureState.featureState attribute is set to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012131 MO instance.
- The InterfaceIPv4 or the InterfaceIPv6 MO is configured.
- The user is assigned the Transport\_Application\_SecurityAdministrator role.
- The node has an active SFTP server.
- Optionally, to capture IPsec traffic, the IpsecTunnel, or the PeerIpsecTunnel MO is configured.

Steps

1. Create a PacketCapture MO instance under the Transport MO.
2. Start the L3 interface-level packet capture or the L2 port-level frame capture by initiating the PacketCapture.start action. Note: Optional settings can be used for filtering and timeout options.
3. Check the status of capturing by initiating the PacketCapture.status action.
4. Stop the capturing by initiating the PacketCapture.stop action.
5. Export the PacketCaptureLog file to the server by initiating the PacketCapture.export action.
6. Decrypt the PacketCaptureLog file using the openssl command. openssl enc -aes-256-ctr -d -in &lt;encrypted\_file&gt; -out &lt;decrypted\_file&gt; -k &lt;passphrase&gt; -md md5. For more information about the PacketCaptureLog, see Manage Transport Network.

## 9.2 Example of Using Packet Capture

A practical example of using the Packet Capture feature.

Steps

1. Create a PacketCapture=1 MO instance under the Transport=1 MO. Example: cr Transport=1,PacketCapture=1.
2. Start the packet capture.
    - Without filtering enabled Example: mcc PacketCapture=1 start --interfaceLdn "ManagedElement=1,Transport=1,Router=LTECP,InterfaceIPv4=TN\_A\_CP" --count 16000.
    - With filtering enabled through specifying the string filter and the uint32 captureTimeout arguments Example: mcc PacketCapture=1 start --interfaceLdn "ManagedElement=1,Transport=1,Router=1, InterfaceIPv4=1" --filter "src host 1.2.3.4 and ip proto \\sctp and dst port 38412" --captureTimeout 1800.
