# 1 NR Intelligent SCell Management Overview

This feature enables UEs to maintain high throughput in EN-DC if the NR SCell coverage

deteriorates. NR SCells that have poor coverage are deconfigured and the eNodeB performs a

new evaluation to configure more LTE SCells.

Summary

The NR Intelligent SCell Management feature deconfigures NR SCells that have poor

coverage instead of deactivating them. When the gNodeB deconfigures an NR SCell, it

performs a new band combination selection, which allows the eNodeB to configure more

LTE SCells at the same time. Therefore, the feature has the potential to enhance UE

throughput.

Without this feature, the UE and the network might have reduced performance and

spectrum utilization in cases when an NR SCell has poor coverage.

The feature has the following benefits:

- Enhanced UE throughput when an NR SCell has poor coverage.
- Increased LTE and NR spectral efficiency

The feature is supported in EN-DC Low-Band and Mid-Band deployments.

# 2 Dependencies of NR Intelligent SCell Management

The feature is supported in EN-DC Low-Band and Mid-Band deployments only, and it is

used together with other NR downlink carrier aggregation features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The feature has the following limitations:

- The feature is supported in EN-DC Low-Band and Mid-Band deployments.
- If the UE moves back into good NR SCell coverage, the previously deconfigured NR SCell is only reconfigured when the next SpCell mobility happens.
- To maintain multi-vendor interoperability, the NR Intelligent SCell Management should not be configured and enabled in Ericsson gNodeBs connected and anchored to other vendor eNodeBs.
- Certain UE types might report incorrect EN-DC capabilities, which might cause these UEs to time out during LTE SCell reconfiguration. As a result, LTE E-RAB retainability for EN-DC-active UEs might increase, which corresponds to an increase in the following KPIs: Differentiated E-RAB Retainability - Percentage Lost E-RAB Retainability - Percentage Lost per QCI Before testing or deploying the feature, it is recommended to confirm that the required UE capabilities are present. Additionally, the UE Grouping Framework can be used to disable the feature for these UEs. For more information, contact the next level of support.

Network Requirements

ENM version 22.3 or later is required to support the MOM

changes introduced by this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Intelligent SCell Management

If this feature is enabled, the gNodeB deconfigures an NR SCell that has poor coverage

and triggers the eNodeB to configure more LTE SCells.

Background and Example

In EN-DC, the eNodeB and the gNodeB can each support downlink carrier aggregation

in their respective cell groups. Depending on its capability, a given UE might

support different carrier aggregation combinations on the LTE and the NR side.

For example, a UE might support the following combinations:

- Two LTE component carriers (SpCell and one SCell) and two NR component carriers (SpCell and one SCell)
- Five LTE component carriers (SpCell and four SCells) and one NR component carrier (SpCell)

In this example, the UE is first configured with the first combination. Then, if

the coverage of the NR SCell deteriorates, that SCell is deactivated but kept

configured. As a result, UE throughput is reduced, because the gNodeB can only

use activated SCells for transmission. If the NR Intelligent SCell Management

feature is disabled, the deactivated SCell is kept configured, so the UE cannot

use the second carrier aggregation combination instead.

However, if the NR Intelligent SCell Management feature is enabled, the gNodeB

can deconfigure the NR SCell that has poor coverage. This allows the eNodeB to

select more LTE SCells to compensate for the throughput degradation on the NR

side.

Figure 1   Example of the Feature Operation

Feature Configuration

The NR Intelligent SCell Management feature is disabled by default. It can be enabled

by setting the CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg.waitForBetterSCellRep

attribute to a value other than -1.

Table 2   Possible Values of the

CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg.waitForBetterSCellRep

Attribute.

Aside from enabling the feature, the

CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg.waitForBetterSCellRep

attribute is also used to control a timer. Based on the value of the timer,

the feature either deactivates or deconfigures an SCell when the gNodeB

receives an A2 measurement report from the UE. The length of the timer must

be set based on proper network planning.

| Value (ms)   | Feature Behavior                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -1           | The feature is disabled.                                                                                                                                            |
| 0            | The feature is enabled, but the timer is disabled. A deactivated                                     NR SCell is deconfigured immediately.                          |
| 1...32000    | Both the feature and the timer are enabled. The higher the value,                                     the longer the gNodeB waits before deconfiguring an NR SCell. |

The feature can be enabled for each NR frequency. This can be achieved by setting a

reference from the desired NRFreqRelation MO to the

CaFreqRelMeasProfile MO instance.

The feature configuration can also be customized for UE groups through the UE

Grouping Framework. To provide UE grouping support for the

CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg.waitForBetterSCellRep attribute,

the following attributes are used:

- CaFreqRelMeasProfile.ueConfGroupType
- CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg.prefUeGroupList
- CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg.ueGroupList
- CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg.ueConfGroupList

Operational Process

Figure 2   Operational Sequence Diagram

The feature has the following operational process:

1. The feature is enabled.
2. An SCell has poor coverage or the UE is out of coverage. To check SCell coverage, the feature uses the SCell-related UE measurements. For more information, see NR DL Carrier Aggregation.
3. The gNodeB deconfigures the NR SCell. Note: The feature does not always deconfigure an SCell immediately. The time to wait is configured with the CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg.waitForBetterSCellRep attribute.
4. The eNodeB selects new LTE SCells.

Parameters for NR Intelligent SCell Management

## 3.1 Deconfiguration of SCells When the UE Is Out of Coverage

The feature is used during initial SCell selection to deconfigure blindly selected NR

SCells if the UE is out of coverage.

Figure 3   SCell Deconfiguration Process at Initial SCell Selection

1. The feature is enabled by setting the CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg.waitForBetterSCellRep attribute to a value other than -1.
2. At initial EN-DC setup, SpCell mobility, or Secondary Cell Group addition, the following actions are performed: The blind selection of SCells is also performed during the following use cases: MeNodeB handover without PSCell change eNodeB initiated Secondary Cell Group addition Intra-gNodeB PSCell change After the initial SCell configuration, the supervision timer must be started in these use cases as well.
    1. The gNodeB performs initial blind SCell selection.
    2. The gNodeB configures the UE with A1, A2, and A6 measurements.
    3. The gNodeB starts the supervision timer. The supervision timer tracks the reception of the A1 and the A2 measurements for different SCell frequencies after initial blind SCell configuration. For information on how the supervision timer is calculated, see NR DL Carrier Aggregation.
3. No A1 or A2 measurement reports are received before the supervision timer expires. The UE is considered to be out of SCell coverage.
4. The gNodeB deconfigures the SCell after the supervision timer expires. The A1 and A2 measurements are removed from the UE. The gNodeB requests Secondary Node modification from the eNodeB.
5. The eNodeB selects new LTE SCells.

## 3.2 Poor Coverage SCell Deconfiguration after A2 Measurement Report

The feature is used when a UE sends an A2 measurement report, which indicates that an

NR SCell has poor coverage.

Figure 4   SCell Deconfiguration Process after A2 Measurement Report

1. The feature is enabled by setting the CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg.waitForBetterSCellRep attribute to a value other than -1.
2. A UE sends an A2 measurement report to the gNodeB. This measurement report indicates that the UE is in poor NR SCell coverage. If the CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg.waitForBetterSCellRep attribute is set to 0, the gNodeB deconfigures the SCell. If the attribute value is larger than 0, the gNodeB deactivates the SCell and starts the timer.
3. If an A1 or A6 measurement report is received while the timer is active, the following actions are performed: The gNodeB stops the timer. If an A1 measurement report is received, the SCell is reactivated. The SCell is kept activated until a new A2 measurement report. If a valid A6 measurement report is received, the gNodeB reconfigures the UE with the new NR SCell. For more information, see NR DL Carrier Aggregation.
4. If no A1 or A6 measurement reports are received before the timer expires, the gNodeB deconfigures the SCell. The A1 and A2 measurements are removed from the UE. The gNodeB requests Secondary Node modification from the eNodeB.
5. The eNodeB selects new LTE SCells.

## 3.3 UE Group Support for NR Intelligent SCell Management

This feature is UE group adapted.

Configuration data from the CaCellMeasProfileUeCfg and

CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg MO classes is selected based on which

UE groups the UE belongs to.

The configuration of the

CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg.waitForBetterSCellRep attribute can be

differentiated for UE groups in the following way:

- When a change occurs based on which UE groups the UE belongs to, the change can result in the selection of new instances of the CaCellMeasProfileUeCfg and CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg MO classes. If the configuration of the CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg.waitForBetterSCellRep attribute changes when the UE is moved to another UE group during an outgoing connection, the attribute is not reconfigured. The UE group support for this function is controlled through the User- and Service-Specific Mobility licensed feature. If the license is not activated, the base instances of the CaCellMeasProfileUeCfg and CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg MO classes are used.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Intelligent SCell Management

The downlink UE throughput can increase.

Capacity and Performance

The downlink UE throughput can increase in EN-DC if the NR SCell coverage

deteriorates. The benefit might be best observed in testing if the following site

and network criteria are fulfilled:

- LTE SCells are available, and the required carrier aggregation extension feature licenses (for example, 5CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension) are activated on the eNodeB.
- The UE can aggregate more LTE SCells.
- The NR SCell has poor coverage, or it is out of coverage for the UE.
- LTE coverage is good.
- NR coverage is noncontiguous, while the LTE coverage is contiguous. Note: In contiguous NR coverage, the UE might perform PSCell change to a neighbor NR cell before the feature is triggered. Therefore, the feature is more suitable for rural sites where PSCell change to neighbor NR cells is less likely or less frequent.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Intelligent SCell Management

The feature introduces attributes to control the feature operation both on the NR

frequency and on the UE group level. If the feature is enabled, it is also recommended to

use a specific attribute configuration on the eNodeB.

Counters

The feature uses the NRCellCU.pmEbsEndcCaDeconfigReason$ EBS-N

flexible counter to monitor the number of NR SCell deconfigurations differentiated

by cause.

Events

- CuCpProcEndcModification
- CuCpProcEndcRelease
- CuCpProcX2SgnbChange

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for NR Intelligent SCell Management

The feature can be configured on NRFreqRelation level and supports

differentiated configuration for UE Groups.

Figure 5   Configuration Management of NR Intelligent SCell Management

## 8.1 Configure the NR Intelligent SCell Management Feature for All UE Connections

The feature can be configured to operate the same way for all UEs. The example

procedure described here uses the automatically created MO instances.

Prerequisites

- The CaFreqRelMeasProfile MO instance is created automatically when the CarrierAggregation parent MO instance is created.
- The CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg MO instance is created automatically when the CaFreqRelMeasProfile parent MO instance is created.

Steps

1. Set the CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg.waitForBetterSCellRep attribute to a desired value other than -1. A higher value means that the gNodeB waits longer when poor NR SCell coverage is reported before the SCell is deconfigured.
2. Set the NRFreqRelation.caFreqRelMeasProfileRef attribute to reference the automatically created CaFreqRelMeasProfile MO instance.

Results

The feature is enabled for the selected NRFreqRelation MO

instance. The configured SCells on this frequency might trigger the feature when

they have poor or no coverage. All connected UEs are treated the same way.

## 8.2 Configure the NR Intelligent SCell Management Feature for Different UE Groups

With the UE Grouping Framework, the feature can be customized for a specific UE

group. The example procedure described here uses the automatically created MO

instances.

Prerequisites

- The CaFreqRelMeasProfile MO instance is created automatically when the CarrierAggregation parent MO instance is created.
- The CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg MO instance is created automatically when the CaFreqRelMeasProfile parent MO instance is created.

Steps

1. Create a preference UE group selection profile under the UeGroupSelection MO class. For more information on creating UE group selection profiles, see UE Grouping Framework.
2. Create an CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg MO instance under the automatically created CaFreqRelMeasProfile MO instance.
3. Set the value of the CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg.prefUeGroupList attribute to the ID of the preference UE group selection profile created at the beginning of this task.
4. Set the CaFreqRelMeasProfileUeCfg.waitForBetterSCellRep attribute to a desired value other than -1. A higher value means that the gNodeB waits longer when poor NR SCell coverage is reported before the SCell is deconfigured.
5. Set the NRFreqRelation.caFreqRelMeasProfileRef attribute to reference the automatically created CaFreqRelMeasProfile MO instance.

Results

The feature is enabled for the selected NRFreqRelation MO

instance. The configured SCells on this frequency might trigger the feature when

they have poor or no coverage. The configuration is assigned to a specific UE

group.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 22.Q4: Measurement Gap Support for NR Intelligent SCell Management

This feature enhancement enables the eNodeB and gNodeB to coordinate the

configuration of measurement gaps after an SCell deconfiguration.

| Feature Name           | NR Intelligent SCell Management   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5460                      |
| Value Package Name     | NR Base Package                   |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4002                      |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node               |
| Access Type            | NR                                |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                         |

Summary and Benefits

With the NR Intelligent SCell Management feature enabled, the gNodeB might

deconfigure an NR SCell as part of the feature operation. If the UE has an A5

measurement on the frequency of this SCell, a measurement gap is needed for the UE

to be able to trigger the A5 event. This feature enhancement enables the use of

these measurement gaps after an SCell deconfiguration in order to correctly

configure and maintain A5 measurements.

The feature enhancement allows the following features, which use A5 measurements, to

work unimpaired with the NR Intelligent SCell Management feature:

- PSCell Change to Higher Priority
- NR Mobility

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

## Appendix A.b: 23.Q2: Additional Traffic Scenarios That Trigger NR SCell Deconfiguration

This feature enhancement supports NR SCell deconfiguration after blind selection when

EN-DC is set up for the secondary gNodeB Addition procedure.

| Feature Name           | NR Intelligent SCell Management   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5460​                     |

| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4002                      |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node               |
| Access Type            | NR                                |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                         |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement supports SCell deconfiguration after blind selection for

the following introduced procedures:

- Master Node Handover without PSCell Change
- ENodeB Initiated Secondary Cell Group Addition
- Intra-gNodeB PSCell Change

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- It improves UE throughput in LTE-NR Downlink Aggregation when an NR SCell is in poor coverage.
- It enables more efficient use of the NR and LTE spectrum.

Capacity and Performance

The Average DL MAC DRB Throughput KPI can be used to monitor SCell deconfiguration

functionality.

The Differentiated Average DL PDCP UE Throughput for LTE Leg using Carrier

Aggregation Captured in eNodeB KPI can be used to monitor UE throughput.

The NR Intelligent SCell Management feature uses the Secondary Node initiated

Secondary Node Modification procedure for the following purposes:

- Measurement gap coordination between the Master Node and Secondary Node
- SCell deconfiguration on the Secondary Node

As a result, the number of the Secondary Node initiated Secondary Node

Modification procedures can increase. This increases the risk of such a procedure

colliding with Master Node initiated procedures. If the collision of procedures

increases, and therefore, the SCG Active Radio Resource Retainability, Captured in

gNodeB KPI might show degradation.

Operation

The NRCellCU.pmEndcCaDeconfigAtt counter is updated so in the

CuCpProcEndcModification event it steps only during SCell procedure failures and not

during PSCell procedure failures. This way the EN-DC SCell deconfiguration success

rate shows higher values if the baseline performance in CuCpProcEndcModification

does not have any SCell procedure but only PSCell procedure failures.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No specific network requirements.

### Appendix A.b.a: 24.Q1.1: Correction of SCell Deconfiguration Process for NR Intelligent SCell Management

This feature enhancement corrects the increase of the

NRCellDU.pmEndcRelUeMenbReconfigFail PM counter related to SCell

configuration in EN-DC.

| Feature Name           | NR Intelligent SCell Management   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5460                      |
| Value Package Name     | NR Base Package                   |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4002                      |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node               |
| Access Type            | NR                                |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                         |

Description of Correction

The value of the NRCellDU.pmEndcRelUeMenbReconfigFail PM counter

is incorrectly stepped in some scenarios when the following conditions are

present:

- The ENodeBFunction.endcIntraBandBlocked attribute in the eNodeB is set to true.
- The NR Intelligent SCell Management feature is active in the gNodeB.

A correction is introduced to avoid the faulty stepping of this PM counter, which

causes an observable decrease for affected cells.

This correction restores the behavior of several counters.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                         |

Description of Correction

From 24.Q3, an issue prevented the gNodeB from configuring EN-DC UEs with the

required measurements for the SCell in Low-Band or Mid-Band if UEs performed

intra-CU PSCell change while keeping the same SCell. In this case, A1, A2, or A6

measurements were not configured for the SCell. The UEs could not report the quality

of coverage for the SCell, and could not report that an offset of an intra-frequency

neighbor cell became better than the configured SCell.

Since EN-DC UEs could not report bad coverage for the configured SCell, the NR Intelligent SCell Management feature could not

operate as expected. SCells that were out of coverage, were kept configured and were

not enabled to evaluate additional SCells on the LTE side of the MCG.

This correction restores the pegging, and the values of the following counters might

increase:

- NRCellCU.pmCaConfigAtt
- NRCellCU.pmCaConfigAttUl
- NRCellCU.pmCaConfigDelaySamp
- NRCellCU.pmCaConfigDelaySum
- NRCellCU.pmCaConfigDlSamp
- NRCellCU.pmCaConfigDlSumEndcDistr
- NRCellCU.pmCaConfigDlSumNrdcDistr
- NRCellCU.pmCaConfigDlSumSaDistr
- NRCellCU.pmCaConfigMaxSa
- NRCellCU.pmCaConfigSucc
- NRCellCU.pmCaConfigSuccUl
- NRCellCU.pmCaConfigUlSumSaDistr
- NRCellCU.pmCaConfiguredSwitchedUl
- NRCellCU.pmCaDeconfigAtt
- NRCellCU.pmCaDeconfigAttUl
- NRCellCU.pmCaDeconfigSucc
- NRCellCU.pmCaDeconfigSuccUl

The value of the NRCellCU.pmCaConfigDlSumEndcDistr PM counter

might show a lower number of configured SCell.

An increase in the number of CU\_CP\_PROC\_ENDC\_MODIFICATION PM events with the

endc\_scell\_deconfig\_reason parameter set as

ENDC\_SCELL\_DECONFIG\_REASON\_POOR\_COVERAGE\_DL might be

observed.
