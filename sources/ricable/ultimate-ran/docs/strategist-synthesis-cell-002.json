  "reasoning": "Strategic synthesis balances analyst's technical recommendation with historian's risk management. The +3.5 dB power increase is conservative (70% of required 5 dB to reach target), complies with 3GPP bounds (new value -1.3 dBm is well within [-130, 46] range), and respects the historian's 5 dB single-step constraint. This staged approach allows for SINR improvement from 4.0 dB → ~7.2 dB (expected 3.2 dB gain), closing ~53% of the gap to target in ROP-1. If SINR reaches 7+ dB, a follow-up +1.5 to +2 dB adjustment can be considered in ROP-2. Moderate interference levels suggest power increase will not trigger significant neighbor cell issues. Rollback threshold set at 5.5 dB to catch any unexpected SINR degradation (current 4.0 - 1.5 dB safety margin). High confidence (82%) based on 85% historical success rate for similar scenarios and conservative parameter selection.",
