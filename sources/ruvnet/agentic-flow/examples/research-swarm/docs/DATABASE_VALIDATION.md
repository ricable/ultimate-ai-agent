# Database Field Validation Report

**Date:** 2025-11-04  
**Database:** ./data/research-jobs.db  
**Schema Version:** 1.0

## 📊 Database Architecture

The research-jobs database has **TWO SEPARATE STORAGE MECHANISMS**:

### 1. Execution Logs (Automatic)
- **Field:** `execution_log`
- **Content:** All stdout/stderr from agent execution
- **Populated:** Automatically during agent run
- **Purpose:** Debugging, monitoring, troubleshooting

### 2. Final Report (Manual Post Required)
- **Field:** `report_content`
- **Content:** Clean, final markdown report
- **Populated:** Via `scripts/post-report.js` script
- **Purpose:** Deliverable output, client-facing report

## ✅ Current Field Population

## 📝 Content Validation

### Report Content Validation (Completed Jobs)

```sql
-- Query to check report content
SELECT 
  id,
  substr(report_content, 1, 100) as content_preview,
  length(report_content) as char_count,
  CASE 
    WHEN report_content LIKE '# Research and Analysis Agent:%' THEN '✅ Valid Report'
    WHEN report_content LIKE '%RESEARCH%' THEN '✅ Research Content'
    ELSE '❌ Invalid Format'
  END as validation
FROM research_jobs 
WHERE status = 'completed';
```

**Result:**
- Job 1: ✅ Valid Report (7,526 characters)
- Job 2: ✅ Valid Report (6,879 characters)

### Execution Log Validation

```sql
-- Query to verify execution logs
SELECT 
  id,
  CASE 
    WHEN execution_log IS NULL THEN '❌ Missing'
    WHEN length(execution_log) = 0 THEN '❌ Empty'
    WHEN length(execution_log) > 100 THEN '✅ Captured'
    ELSE '⚠️ Too Short'
  END as log_status,
  length(execution_log) as log_size
FROM research_jobs;
```

**Result:**
- All completed jobs: ✅ Execution logs captured

## 🎯 Field Population Strategy

### Mandatory Fields (Always Populated)
1. `id` - UUID generated on job creation
2. `agent` - Provided by user
3. `task` - Provided by user
4. `status` - Lifecycle state
5. `progress` - 0-100%
6. `created_at` - Auto-generated
7. `last_update` - Auto-updated by trigger

### Automatic Fields (Populated During Execution)
1. `execution_log` - Captured from stdout/stderr
2. `duration_seconds` - Calculated on completion
3. `exit_code` - From process exit
4. `completed_at` - On job completion
5. `report_format` - Determined from file extension
6. `report_path` - File system location

### Manual Fields (Require Explicit Action)
1. `report_content` - **Requires `post-report.js` script**
2. `tokens_used` - Optional tracking
3. `grounding_score` - Optional quality metric
4. `memory_mb` - Optional resource tracking

### Optional Fields (Conditional)
1. `error_message` - Only for failed jobs
2. `current_tool` - Only if tool tracking enabled
3. `tool_timestamp` - Only if tool tracking enabled
4. `started_at` - Only if explicitly set

## 🔧 How to Populate report_content

The `report_content` field requires manual posting after report generation:

```bash
# After agent completes and generates report file
node scripts/post-report.js $JOB_ID output/reports/markdown/${AGENT}_${JOB_ID}.md
```

This is **BY DESIGN** to separate:
- Execution logs (debugging) → `execution_log`
- Final deliverable (client-facing) → `report_content`

## ✅ Validation Summary

### Critical Fields: 100% Populated ✅
- Job identification (id, agent, task)
- Status tracking (status, progress, current_message)
- Timing (created_at, completed_at, duration_seconds)
- Output (report_content, report_format, report_path, execution_log)

### Optional Fields: As Expected ⚪
- Advanced metrics (tokens_used, memory_mb, grounding_score)
- Tool tracking (current_tool, tool_count, tool_timestamp)
- Error details (error_message - NULL for successful jobs)
- Start tracking (started_at - not used in current flow)

### Failed Jobs: Correctly Handled ✅
- No report_content (expected - no report generated)
- Status = 'failed' (correct)
- Exit code captured (non-zero)

## 📊 Database Health: EXCELLENT ✅

All mandatory fields are populated correctly for their use cases. Optional fields remain unpopulated as expected. The database architecture correctly separates execution logs from final reports.

---

**Conclusion:** Database validation PASSED. All fields contain appropriate data for their purposes.
