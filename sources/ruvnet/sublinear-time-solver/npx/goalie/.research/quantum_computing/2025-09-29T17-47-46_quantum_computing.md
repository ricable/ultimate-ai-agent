**Query:** quantum computing
**Date:** 2025-09-29T17:47:46.505Z

## Answer

Quantum computing is a rapidly advancing field that uses the principles of quantum mechanics—specifically, phenomena like **superposition** and **entanglement**—to process information in fundamentally new ways, enabling certain computations to be performed exponentially faster than on classical computers[1][2][3][4].

**Key Concepts and How Quantum Computing Works:**

- **Qubits:** The basic unit of quantum information is the **qubit** (quantum bit), which, unlike a classical bit that can be either 0 or 1, can exist in a superposition of both 0 and 1 simultaneously[1][2][3][4]. This property allows quantum computers to represent and process a vast number of possible states at once, exponentially increasing computational power with each additional qubit[1][2].

- **Superposition:** A qubit can be in a state where it is both 0 and 1 at the same time, described mathematically as a linear combination of these states. This enables quantum computers to explore many possible solutions in parallel[1][2][4].

- **Entanglement:** Qubits can be **entangled**, meaning the state of one qubit is directly related to the state of another, no matter the distance between them. This correlation is used to perform complex calculations more efficiently and is a key resource for quantum algorithms[1][2][4].

- **Quantum Gates and Algorithms:** Quantum computers manipulate qubits using quantum gates, which perform operations analogous to logic gates in classical computing but can exploit superposition and entanglement. Quantum algorithms, such as Shor’s algorithm for factoring large numbers, can solve certain problems much faster than classical algorithms[3][4].

**Hardware and Implementation:**

- **Physical Realizations:** Qubits can be implemented using various physical systems, including superconducting circuits, trapped ions, photons, and semiconductors[2][3]. Each approach has trade-offs in terms of scalability, stability, and error rates.

- **Quantum Chips:** The core of a quantum computer is the quantum chip or processor, which contains the physical qubits and the necessary structures to control and read them. These chips must be kept at extremely low temperatures to minimize noise and decoherence[2].

- **Error Correction:** Qubits are highly sensitive to environmental disturbances, leading to errors. Quantum error correction techniques use multiple physical qubits to encode a more stable "logical qubit," which is essential for building practical, large-scale quantum computers.

**Current State and Applications:**

- **Development Stage:** As of 2025, quantum computers with over 100 qubits exist, but most are still in the research and development phase, focusing on improving qubit quality, error correction, and scalability[6]. Major companies like IBM, Google, and Microsoft have published roadmaps for scaling up quantum processors and achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing[6].

- **Quantum Supremacy:** This term refers to the point where a quantum computer can solve a problem infeasible for any classical computer. Google’s "Willow" chip recently demonstrated this for a specific benchmark problem, though practical, real-world applications are still emerging[6].

- **Potential Applications:** Quantum computing holds promise for revolutionizing fields such as:
  - **Cryptography:** Breaking widely used encryption methods and driving the development of quantum-resistant cryptography[4][5].
  - **Drug Discovery and Materials Science:** Simulating molecular interactions at the quantum level, enabling faster and more accurate predictions for new drugs and materials[3][5][6].
  - **Optimization and Machine Learning:** Solving complex optimization problems and enhancing machine learning algorithms[3][5][6].

**Challenges and Outlook:**

- **Scalability and Fault Tolerance:** Building quantum computers with enough high-fidelity logical qubits to solve practical problems remains a major challenge[6].
- **Integration with Classical Computing:** Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are being developed to leverage the strengths of both paradigms[5].
- **Global Investment:** Governments and industry are investing heavily in quantum technology, recognizing its strategic importance for science, security, and the economy[3][6].

Quantum computing is transitioning from theoretical exploration to practical innovation, with ongoing breakthroughs in hardware, algorithms, and applications expected to reshape technology in the coming years[5][6].

**URL:** https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-year-of-quantum-from-concept-to-reality-in-2025

**When it comes to quantum technology (QT),** investment is surging and breakthroughs are multiplying. The United Nations has designated 2025 the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology, celebrating 100 years since the initial development of quantum mechanics. Our research confirms that QT is gaining widespread traction worldwide. McKinsey’s fourth annual *Quantum Technology Monitor* covers last year’s breakthroughs, investment trends, and emerging opportunities in this fast-evolving landscape.

In 2024, the QT industry saw a shift from growing quantum bits (qubits) to stabilizing qubits—and that marks a turning point. It signals to mission-critical industries that QT could soon become a safe and reliable component of their technology infrastructure. To that end, this year’s report provides a special deep dive into the fast-growing market of quantum communication, which could unlock the security needed for widespread QT uptake.

## What is quantum technology?

Quantum technology encompasses three subfields:

- Quantum computing is a new computing paradigm that capitalizes on the laws of quantum mechanics to provide significant performance improvement for certain applications, and to enable new territories of computing beyond existing classical computing.

- Quantum communication is the secure transfer of quantum information across distances and could ensure security of communication even in the face of unlimited quantum computing power.

- Quantum sensing includes a new generation of sensors, based on quantum systems, that provide measurements of various quantities (for example, electromagnetic fields, gravity, or time) and that are orders of magnitude more sensitive than classical sensors.

Our new research shows that the three core pillars of QT—quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing—could together generate up to $97 billion in revenue worldwide by 2035. Quantum computing will capture the bulk of that revenue, growing from $4 billion in revenue in 2024 to as much as $72 billion in 2035 (see sidebar “What is quantum technology?”). While QT will affect many industries, the chemicals, life sciences, finance, and mobility industries will see the most growth.... ## About the report

McKinsey initiated its annual quantum technology report in 2021 to track the rapidly evolving quantum technology landscape. We analyze three principal areas of the field: quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. The analysis is based on input from various sources, including publicly available data, expert interviews, and proprietary McKinsey analyses. The conclusions and estimations have been cross-checked across market databases and validated through investor reports, press releases, and expert input. Because not all deal values are publicly disclosed and databases are updated continuously, our research does not provide a definitive or exhaustive list of start-ups, funding activities, investment splits, or patents and publications.

We conducted extensive analysis to project the 2035 global market sizes for each of the three pillars of QT. We found that by 2035, quantum computing could be worth $28 billion to $72 billion, quantum communication could be worth $11 billion to $15 billion, and quantum sensing could be worth $7 billion to $10 billion—for a total of as much as $97 billion. This growth shows no signs of slowing. We predict that by 2040, the total QT market could reach $198 billion. We present our market size estimates as a range because of the large variance in potential technological progress, adoption rates, and scaling opportunities for QT in the decade to come (see sidebar “About the report”).... ### A surge in public funding

Global governments’ $680 million worth of investments in QT start-ups in 2024 was only part of their commitment to the sector. Overall, governments announced $1.8 billion in funding for all types of QT endeavors in 2024. For example, the Australian government announced a $620 million financial package for PsiQuantum to build the world’s first utility-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer in Brisbane.

1 Meanwhile, the State of Illinois announced a $500 million investment in the development of a quantum park. 2 Asian investments also rose in 2024, led by Singapore’s approximately $222 million investment in QT research and talent. 3 Five of the 19 new QT start-ups founded in 2024 are based in Asia, underscoring the region’s emerging dominance in the field.

The government-backed QT financing trend shows no signs of slowing. In fact, it accelerated in the first months of 2025 when Japan announced a $7.4 billion bet on the sector and Spain committed to investing $900 million, bringing announcements for public financing to more than $10 billion (Exhibit 2).... ## Breakthrough innovations

For the first time since McKinsey began monitoring the QT market four years ago, we see a shift from development to deployment. Much of the innovation that emerged in 2024 has made QT safer and more secure. And while the QT start-up ecosystem is fertile ground for potential breakthroughs, leading technology companies drove the bulk of change in 2024. Companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft continued to progress in quantum innovation, unveiling key breakthroughs that signal a new era for the industry. Notable recent advancements from large companies include the suppression of error rates relative to the number of qubits; the development of multiple high-fidelity qubits; and substantial reductions in the cost of quantum error correction.

### Quantum control solutions

Our research shows that start-ups and large companies also made progress in 2024 within quantum control solutions—the hardware and software that enable quantum systems to perform critical functions such as qubit initialization, gate operations, error correction, and readouts. For example, Australian start-up Q-CTRL partnered with Nvidia and OQC to overcome computational bottlenecks in error suppression.

4 Other companies also made progress, including IBM, Keysight, Kipu Quantum, Quantum Machines, Qedma, and Zurich Instruments.

### The critical role of error correction

Error correction, a critical element of quantum control, emerged as a key innovation in 2024, with Google’s Willow quantum computing chip demonstrating significant advancements in error correction and performance. With 105 physical qubits, Willow can perform certain complex calculations exponentially faster than supercomputers and with a low error rate.

5 Start-ups, too, showed progress on error correction. For example, Alice & Bob presented a new quantum error correction architecture, 6 Riverlane unveiled a hardware-based quantum error decoder with enhanced speed and efficiency, 7 QuEra launched a logical quantum processor based on reconfigurable atom arrays, 8 and Atom Computing collaborated with Microsoft to deliver quantum error correction. 9

As the number of qubits grows, effective error correction—as well as suppression and mitigation—is no longer optional. Ensuring QT systems are less prone to error is essential for achieving the stability and accuracy needed to deploy quantum applications at scale.... ### Progress on patents

With an eye to cementing early advantage in the QT sector, companies are patenting their breakthroughs. Our research shows a 13 percent increase in the number of QT patents granted in 2024 compared to a year earlier. IBM had the highest number (191), followed by Google with 168.

On a country level, China and the United States filed the most QT patent applications in 2024, with China leading in quantum computing patents (Exhibit 3). Meanwhile, the United States led in quantum communication patents, propelled by the efforts of national labs such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology and research institutes. These advancements highlight the United States’ strategic focus on advancing the field of quantum security.... ### Advances in quantum sensing

Quantum sensing has entered a pivotal phase, and real-world application development will be central to unlocking its full potential. The field saw significant breakthroughs in 2024 and early 2025, particularly in use cases across defense and semiconductors. With quantum sensing technology maturing beyond foundational research, the focus is now on production and deployment. Notable advances over the past year include NASA’s first demonstration of an ultracold quantum sensor in space; Q-CTRL’s use of quantum magnetometers to navigate GPS-denied environments; QuantumDiamonds’ launch of a diamond-based microscopy tool for semiconductor failure analysis; and SandboxAQ’s introduction of AQNav, a real-time, AI-driven quantum navigation system.

## Looking ahead

QT delivers value not only on its own but also by unlocking powerful synergies with other cutting-edge technologies. Our research explores how QT could both influence and be shaped by four key innovation domains: AI and machine learning, robotics, sustainability and climate tech, and cryptography and cybersecurity.

**AI and machine learning**have the potential to accelerate quantum hardware development through AI-driven material discovery, while quantum computing offers transformative leaps in computational power that could redefine the scale and speed of AI model training. **Robotics**plays a key role in advancing quantum technology by streamlining the manufacturing of quantum components. In turn, robotics can potentially benefit from all three pillars of quantum technology: Quantum computing can boost computing power and software optimization, quantum communication can support secure networks, and quantum sensors can enhance the precision of robots. **Sustainability and climate tech**stand to benefit from quantum advances, particularly in computing, because these advances can accelerate material discovery, improve modeling of complex systems such as molecular interactions or climate forecasting, and optimize production processes. **Cryptography and cybersecurity**could be fundamentally reshaped by quantum technology, posing new risks—such as QT’s potential ability to break current encryption—while also boosting next-generation protections, including key distribution, random-number generation, and cryptographic methods designed to withstand quantum attacks.

**When it comes to quantum technology (QT),** investment is surging and breakthroughs are multiplying. The United Nations has designated 2025 the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology, celebrating 100 years since the initial development of quantum mechanics. Our research confirms that QT is gaining widespread traction worldwide. McKinsey’s fourth annual *Quantum Technology Monitor* covers last year’s breakthroughs, investment trends, and emerging opportunities in this fast-evolving landscape.

In 2024, the QT industry saw a shift from growing quantum bits (qubits) to stabilizing qubits—and that marks a turning point. It signals to mission-critical industries that QT could soon become a safe and reliable component of their technology infrastructure. To that end, this year’s report provides a special deep dive into the fast-growing market of quantum communication, which could unlock the security needed for widespread QT uptake.

## What is quantum technology?

Quantum technology encompasses three subfields:

- Quantum computing is a new computing paradigm that capitalizes on the laws of quantum mechanics to provide significant performance improvement for certain applications, and to enable new territories of computing beyond existing classical computing.

- Quantum communication is the secure transfer of quantum information across distances and could ensure security of communication even in the face of unlimited quantum computing power.

- Quantum sensing includes a new generation of sensors, based on quantum systems, that provide measurements of various quantities (for example, electromagnetic fields, gravity, or time) and that are orders of magnitude more sensitive than classical sensors.

Our new research shows that the three core pillars of QT—quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing—could together generate up to $97 billion in revenue worldwide by 2035. Quantum computing will capture the bulk of that revenue, growing from $4 billion in revenue in 2024 to as much as $72 billion in 2035 (see sidebar “What is quantum technology?”). While QT will affect many industries, the chemicals, life sciences, finance, and mobility industries will see the most growth.... ## About the report

McKinsey initiated its annual quantum technology report in 2021 to track the rapidly evolving quantum technology landscape. We analyze three principal areas of the field: quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. The analysis is based on input from various sources, including publicly available data, expert interviews, and proprietary McKinsey analyses. The conclusions and estimations have been cross-checked across market databases and validated through investor reports, press releases, and expert input. Because not all deal values are publicly disclosed and databases are updated continuously, our research does not provide a definitive or exhaustive list of start-ups, funding activities, investment splits, or patents and publications.

We conducted extensive analysis to project the 2035 global market sizes for each of the three pillars of QT. We found that by 2035, quantum computing could be worth $28 billion to $72 billion, quantum communication could be worth $11 billion to $15 billion, and quantum sensing could be worth $7 billion to $10 billion—for a total of as much as $97 billion. This growth shows no signs of slowing. We predict that by 2040, the total QT market could reach $198 billion. We present our market size estimates as a range because of the large variance in potential technological progress, adoption rates, and scaling opportunities for QT in the decade to come (see sidebar “About the report”).... ### A surge in public funding

Global governments’ $680 million worth of investments in QT start-ups in 2024 was only part of their commitment to the sector. Overall, governments announced $1.8 billion in funding for all types of QT endeavors in 2024. For example, the Australian government announced a $620 million financial package for PsiQuantum to build the world’s first utility-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer in Brisbane.

1 Meanwhile, the State of Illinois announced a $500 million investment in the development of a quantum park. 2 Asian investments also rose in 2024, led by Singapore’s approximately $222 million investment in QT research and talent. 3 Five of the 19 new QT start-ups founded in 2024 are based in Asia, underscoring the region’s emerging dominance in the field.

The government-backed QT financing trend shows no signs of slowing. In fact, it accelerated in the first months of 2025 when Japan announced a $7.4 billion bet on the sector and Spain committed to investing $900 million, bringing announcements for public financing to more than $10 billion (Exhibit 2).... ## Breakthrough innovations

For the first time since McKinsey began monitoring the QT market four years ago, we see a shift from development to deployment. Much of the innovation that emerged in 2024 has made QT safer and more secure. And while the QT start-up ecosystem is fertile ground for potential breakthroughs, leading technology companies drove the bulk of change in 2024. Companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft continued to progress in quantum innovation, unveiling key breakthroughs that signal a new era for the industry. Notable recent advancements from large companies include the suppression of error rates relative to the number of qubits; the development of multiple high-fidelity qubits; and substantial reductions in the cost of quantum error correction.

### Quantum control solutions

Our research shows that start-ups and large companies also made progress in 2024 within quantum control solutions—the hardware and software that enable quantum systems to perform critical functions such as qubit initialization, gate operations, error correction, and readouts. For example, Australian start-up Q-CTRL partnered with Nvidia and OQC to overcome computational bottlenecks in error suppression.

4 Other companies also made progress, including IBM, Keysight, Kipu Quantum, Quantum Machines, Qedma, and Zurich Instruments.

### The critical role of error correction

Error correction, a critical element of quantum control, emerged as a key innovation in 2024, with Google’s Willow quantum computing chip demonstrating significant advancements in error correction and performance. With 105 physical qubits, Willow can perform certain complex calculations exponentially faster than supercomputers and with a low error rate.

5 Start-ups, too, showed progress on error correction. For example, Alice & Bob presented a new quantum error correction architecture, 6 Riverlane unveiled a hardware-based quantum error decoder with enhanced speed and efficiency, 7 QuEra launched a logical quantum processor based on reconfigurable atom arrays, 8 and Atom Computing collaborated with Microsoft to deliver quantum error correction. 9

As the number of qubits grows, effective error correction—as well as suppression and mitigation—is no longer optional. Ensuring QT systems are less prone to error is essential for achieving the stability and accuracy needed to deploy quantum applications at scale.... ### Progress on patents

With an eye to cementing early advantage in the QT sector, companies are patenting their breakthroughs. Our research shows a 13 percent increase in the number of QT patents granted in 2024 compared to a year earlier. IBM had the highest number (191), followed by Google with 168.

On a country level, China and the United States filed the most QT patent applications in 2024, with China leading in quantum computing patents (Exhibit 3). Meanwhile, the United States led in quantum communication patents, propelled by the efforts of national labs such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology and research institutes. These advancements highlight the United States’ strategic focus on advancing the field of quantum security.... ### Advances in quantum sensing

Quantum sensing has entered a pivotal phase, and real-world application development will be central to unlocking its full potential. The field saw significant breakthroughs in 2024 and early 2025, particularly in use cases across defense and semiconductors. With quantum sensing technology maturing beyond foundational research, the focus is now on production and deployment. Notable advances over the past year include NASA’s first demonstration of an ultracold quantum sensor in space; Q-CTRL’s use of quantum magnetometers to navigate GPS-denied environments; QuantumDiamonds’ launch of a diamond-based microscopy tool for semiconductor failure analysis; and SandboxAQ’s introduction of AQNav, a real-time, AI-driven quantum navigation system.

## Looking ahead

QT delivers value not only on its own but also by unlocking powerful synergies with other cutting-edge technologies. Our research explores how QT could both influence and be shaped by four key innovation domains: AI and machine learning, robotics, sustainability and climate tech, and cryptography and cybersecurity.

**AI and machine learning**have the potential to accelerate quantum hardware development through AI-driven material discovery, while quantum computing offers transformative leaps in computational power that could redefine the scale and speed of AI model training. **Robotics**plays a key role in advancing quantum technology by streamlining the manufacturing of quantum components. In turn, robotics can potentially benefit from all three pillars of quantum technology: Quantum computing can boost computing power and software optimization, quantum communication can support secure networks, and quantum sensors can enhance the precision of robots. **Sustainability and climate tech**stand to benefit from quantum advances, particularly in computing, because these advances can accelerate material discovery, improve modeling of complex systems such as molecular interactions or climate forecasting, and optimize production processes. **Cryptography and cybersecurity**could be fundamentally reshaped by quantum technology, posing new risks—such as QT’s potential ability to break current encryption—while also boosting next-generation protections, including key distribution, random-number generation, and cryptographic methods designed to withstand quantum attacks.
