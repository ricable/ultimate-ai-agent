### 2. The Year of Quantum: From concept to reality in 2025

**URL:** https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-year-of-quantum-from-concept-to-reality-in-2025

**When it comes to quantum technology (QT),** investment is surging and breakthroughs are multiplying. The United Nations has designated 2025 the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology, celebrating 100 years since the initial development of quantum mechanics. Our research confirms that QT is gaining widespread traction worldwide. McKinsey’s fourth annual *Quantum Technology Monitor* covers last year’s breakthroughs, investment trends, and emerging opportunities in this fast-evolving landscape.

In 2024, the QT industry saw a shift from growing quantum bits (qubits) to stabilizing qubits—and that marks a turning point. It signals to mission-critical industries that QT could soon become a safe and reliable component of their technology infrastructure. To that end, this year’s report provides a special deep dive into the fast-growing market of quantum communication, which could unlock the security needed for widespread QT uptake.

## What is quantum technology?

Quantum technology encompasses three subfields:

- Quantum computing is a new computing paradigm that capitalizes on the laws of quantum mechanics to provide significant performance improvement for certain applications, and to enable new territories of computing beyond existing classical computing.

- Quantum communication is the secure transfer of quantum information across distances and could ensure security of communication even in the face of unlimited quantum computing power.

- Quantum sensing includes a new generation of sensors, based on quantum systems, that provide measurements of various quantities (for example, electromagnetic fields, gravity, or time) and that are orders of magnitude more sensitive than classical sensors.

Our new research shows that the three core pillars of QT—quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing—could together generate up to $97 billion in revenue worldwide by 2035. Quantum computing will capture the bulk of that revenue, growing from $4 billion in revenue in 2024 to as much as $72 billion in 2035 (see sidebar “What is quantum technology?”). While QT will affect many industries, the chemicals, life sciences, finance, and mobility industries will see the most growth.... ## Breakthrough innovations

For the first time since McKinsey began monitoring the QT market four years ago, we see a shift from development to deployment. Much of the innovation that emerged in 2024 has made QT safer and more secure. And while the QT start-up ecosystem is fertile ground for potential breakthroughs, leading technology companies drove the bulk of change in 2024. Companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft continued to progress in quantum innovation, unveiling key breakthroughs that signal a new era for the industry. Notable recent advancements from large companies include the suppression of error rates relative to the number of qubits; the development of multiple high-fidelity qubits; and substantial reductions in the cost of quantum error correction.

### Quantum control solutions

Our research shows that start-ups and large companies also made progress in 2024 within quantum control solutions—the hardware and software that enable quantum systems to perform critical functions such as qubit initialization, gate operations, error correction, and readouts. For example, Australian start-up Q-CTRL partnered with Nvidia and OQC to overcome computational bottlenecks in error suppression.

4 Other companies also made progress, including IBM, Keysight, Kipu Quantum, Quantum Machines, Qedma, and Zurich Instruments.

### The critical role of error correction

Error correction, a critical element of quantum control, emerged as a key innovation in 2024, with Google’s Willow quantum computing chip demonstrating significant advancements in error correction and performance. With 105 physical qubits, Willow can perform certain complex calculations exponentially faster than supercomputers and with a low error rate.

5 Start-ups, too, showed progress on error correction. For example, Alice & Bob presented a new quantum error correction architecture, 6 Riverlane unveiled a hardware-based quantum error decoder with enhanced speed and efficiency, 7 QuEra launched a logical quantum processor based on reconfigurable atom arrays, 8 and Atom Computing collaborated with Microsoft to deliver quantum error correction. 9

As the number of qubits grows, effective error correction—as well as suppression and mitigation—is no longer optional. Ensuring QT systems are less prone to error is essential for achieving the stability and accuracy needed to deploy quantum applications at scale.... ### Progress on patents

With an eye to cementing early advantage in the QT sector, companies are patenting their breakthroughs. Our research shows a 13 percent increase in the number of QT patents granted in 2024 compared to a year earlier. IBM had the highest number (191), followed by Google with 168.

On a country level, China and the United States filed the most QT patent applications in 2024, with China leading in quantum computing patents (Exhibit 3). Meanwhile, the United States led in quantum communication patents, propelled by the efforts of national labs such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology and research institutes. These advancements highlight the United States’ strategic focus on advancing the field of quantum security.... ### Gaining traction in quantum communication

The potential arrival of Q-Day, when quantum computers become powerful enough to break current encryption standards and critical digital infrastructure worldwide, represents a major shift in security. Companies will need to rethink their global security strategies—and adopting quantum communication will be a cornerstone of their new approach. Quantum communication technologies allow the secure transfer of quantum information at scale, and the market is growing quickly.

By analyzing current product offerings and emerging technological trends, we estimate that the total quantum communication market size was $1.2 billion in 2024 and that it will reach $10.5 billion to $14.9 billion by 2035—representing a CAGR of 22 to 25 percent over the next decade (Exhibit 4).

The quantum communication landscape comprises three key categories—security, networks, and services. Within these, we analyzed six important verticals—quantum key distribution solutions, post-quantum cryptography (PQC), modular interconnects, regional networks, quantum global internet, and quantum communication services. In 2024, the vertical with the most commercial maturity was PQC, which focuses on building algorithms to withstand attacks from quantum computers. PQC technology is critical to ensure data security on Q-day and beyond.

Our research shows that governments are currently the largest purchasers of quantum communication technologies, at approximately 57 percent of all purchases in 2024, but the private sector is increasingly adopting the technology. By 2035, for instance, our analysis shows that the telecommunications sector is expected to account for 16 to 26 percent of overall spending on quantum communication products.

The quantum communication value chain ranges from components, hardware, and application software to quantum network operators and services. Hardware is still emerging but holds significant promise. For instance, long-distance communication requires quantum repeaters, or hardware devices that amplify the signal. Start-ups and big-tech players alike are racing to develop repeaters and other hardware, even while the software market itself is still small. Doing so will allow companies to get ahead in the quantum communication market and be ready with their hardware devices when the software side catches up.... ### Advances in quantum sensing

Quantum sensing has entered a pivotal phase, and real-world application development will be central to unlocking its full potential. The field saw significant breakthroughs in 2024 and early 2025, particularly in use cases across defense and semiconductors. With quantum sensing technology maturing beyond foundational research, the focus is now on production and deployment. Notable advances over the past year include NASA’s first demonstration of an ultracold quantum sensor in space; Q-CTRL’s use of quantum magnetometers to navigate GPS-denied environments; QuantumDiamonds’ launch of a diamond-based microscopy tool for semiconductor failure analysis; and SandboxAQ’s introduction of AQNav, a real-time, AI-driven quantum navigation system.

## Looking ahead

QT delivers value not only on its own but also by unlocking powerful synergies with other cutting-edge technologies. Our research explores how QT could both influence and be shaped by four key innovation domains: AI and machine learning, robotics, sustainability and climate tech, and cryptography and cybersecurity.

**AI and machine learning**have the potential to accelerate quantum hardware development through AI-driven material discovery, while quantum computing offers transformative leaps in computational power that could redefine the scale and speed of AI model training. **Robotics**plays a key role in advancing quantum technology by streamlining the manufacturing of quantum components. In turn, robotics can potentially benefit from all three pillars of quantum technology: Quantum computing can boost computing power and software optimization, quantum communication can support secure networks, and quantum sensors can enhance the precision of robots. **Sustainability and climate tech**stand to benefit from quantum advances, particularly in computing, because these advances can accelerate material discovery, improve modeling of complex systems such as molecular interactions or climate forecasting, and optimize production processes. **Cryptography and cybersecurity**could be fundamentally reshaped by quantum technology, posing new risks—such as QT’s potential ability to break current encryption—while also boosting next-generation protections, including key distribution, random-number generation, and cryptographic methods designed to withstand quantum attacks.

# Quantum Breakthroughs of 2024: Beyond the Buzz Around Google

Dec 17, 2024 Dr Tess Skyrme

In the last week Google's latest quantum breakthrough has been splashed across the headlines. This has created a surge of interest in quantum and the revolutionary potential of this technology. IDTechEx has been following key trends in the quantum technology market for many years, and this article picks out key takeaways you should know that go beyond the buzz.

What should you make of Google's quantum chip 'Willow'

For those new to quantum computing, the idea is that by replacing classical bits with entangled quantum bits (qubits), we should be able to solve problems that would take the machines of today eons to solve. Of course, this is hugely simplified, but is at the core of the recent messaging to come out of Google. They claim that their new Willow chip performed a computation in less than five minutes that it would take even the fastest available supercomputers 10 septillion years to achieve. Speed-ups of this scale represent such a paradigm shift that it is difficult to conceive of some of the potential applications of such advanced computing power. Big-picture ideas include designing better materials for more sustainable energy solutions or effective drug treatments.

However, it's worth delving into the details before getting too excited about this announcement from Google. The problem the chip solved in 2024 was a particular type of algorithm that, whilst incredibly challenging to classically solve, has little to no real-world applications. Using a so-called 'toy problem' was also the approach Google used to proclaim that they had achieved quantum supremacy with their Sycamore chip just a few years ago. The company don't shy away from this, but it's easy to miss if you focus on the headlines alone.... Progress towards better error-correction can be found industry-wide (not just at Google)

In terms of a breakthrough, Google's announcement is not a watershed moment for quantum computing to start competing with classical computers on a commercial scale. What is exciting for the industry is Google's progress toward error correction with the Willow chip.

In short, whilst qubits are really powerful, they are also vulnerable to errors. For example, part of the reason players like Google, IBM and so on are using superconducting methods of quantum computing is because operating at incredibly low temperatures creates an ultra-low noise environment as a method to minimize errors.

Error correction has been the focus of the entire quantum computing industry for quite some time. Benchmarks such as fidelity and coherence time are both, in part, a reflection of robustness to error. In fact, in 2024, there were a host of exciting announcements from companies big and small on these themes. This includes Quantinuum and Oxford Ionics, which are noted because their trapped ion approach (an alternative to using superconducting qubits) potentially has less infrastructure and resource demands at scale compared to Google's design. Overall, however, the takeaway is that Google isn't alone in its quest for error correction, and in making progress towards improving it in 2024.

Why it's worth 'taking 5' before getting too excited about quantum computing... In an era where there is so much hype around AI, semiconductors packaging and the future of computing more broadly, quantum computing was already receiving some renewed attention before Google's news. Without over-analyzing short term stock trends, the recent price rises seen by numerous public quantum computing companies such as D-Wave, IonQ, Rigetti and so on can likely be attributed at least in part to increased investor confidence that the technology is 'going somewhere'. Announcements from players as high profile as Google also serve this purpose in the short term.

IDTechEx suggests it's worth 'taking five' before getting too over excited about the impact of quantum computing. Firstly, only a small percent of quantum computing companies out there are public, and most were formed as SPACs which have stock market characteristics of their own to consider entirely separate from the world of quantum physics. More so, however, when you look at the roadmaps from the 20+ players developing quantum computers, including the private players, there is a common theme that real-world value from these machines is unlikely to be achieved until around 2030 (aka 5 years' time). The 2030 horizon has been picked out by IBM, IQM, Quantinuum, IonQ, and more. There is a lot more of the quantum industry to understand than what you'll find in the financial pages, and a little more patience needed just yet.... Quantum technology is about more than just computing

To go further still, it's not even all about quantum computing. The quantum technology market for quantum sensing and quantum communications solutions is also growing fast. There is an array of products in development, and many are commercially available now that can offer orders of magnitude increases in sensor performance or state-of-the-art data security solutions. There are opportunities to benefit from the disruptive potential of quantum without pinning hopes on quantum computing, and certainly single companies in the space alone.

Conclusions and Market Outlook

It's really exciting to see quantum computing capture more attention when actors like Google announce a breakthrough. Indeed, what the Google team have achieved is seriously impressive. Yet, it's important not to equate demonstrations on mathematically interesting problems to an inflection point for commercial adoption.

More advancements in error correction, hardware scalability, algorithm development and infrastructure optimization are essential before quantum computing can truly reach its full potential. Yet it is reassuring to see that the wider world is waking up to the progress the entire industry is making towards this goal, and that the narrative that quantum is destined to remain a lab novelty is fading.

2024 will likely be seen as an important year in quantum computing, but not necessarily a breakthrough year. For now, eyes are more firmly fixed on around five years' time in 2030. For nearer term disruption it could well be worth diverting attention to other areas in the quantum technology market including quantum sensing and quantum communications. Better still, identify and address the needs across the entire quantum technology market for novel materials, component, photonics and manufacturing solutions.... IDTechEx's report "Quantum Computing Market 2025-2045: Technology, Trends, Players, Forecasts" covers the hardware that promises a revolutionary approach to solving the world's unmet challenges. The quantum computing market is pitched as enabling exponentially faster drug discovery, battery chemistry development, multi-variable logistics, vehicle autonomy, accurate asset pricing, and much more. Drawing on extensive primary and secondary research, including interviews with companies and attendance at multiple conferences, this report provides an in-depth evaluation of the competing quantum computing technologies: superconducting, silicon-spin, photonic, trapped-ion, neutral-atom, topological, diamond-defect and annealing. IDTechEx also presents an independent scores for 'quantum commercial readiness level' to assess how the quantum computing industry is progressing compared to the evolution of the classical computing industry that came before it.

There are opportunities to benefit from the disruptive potential of quantum without pinning hopes on quantum computing, and certainly single companies in the space alone.

Conclusions and Market Outlook

It's really exciting to see quantum computing capture more attention when actors like Google announce a breakthrough. Indeed, what the Google team have achieved is seriously impressive. Yet, it's important not to equate demonstrations on mathematically interesting problems to an inflection point for commercial adoption.

More advancements in error correction, hardware scalability, algorithm development and infrastructure optimization are essential before quantum computing can truly reach its full potential. Yet it is reassuring to see that the wider world is waking up to the progress the entire industry is making towards this goal, and that the narrative that quantum is destined to remain a lab novelty is fading.

2024 will likely be seen as an important year in quantum computing, but not necessarily a breakthrough year. For now, eyes are more firmly fixed on around five years' time in 2030. For nearer term disruption it could well be worth diverting attention to other areas in the quantum technology market including quantum sensing and quantum communications. Better still, identify and address the needs across the entire quantum technology market for novel materials, component, photonics and manufacturing solutions....
