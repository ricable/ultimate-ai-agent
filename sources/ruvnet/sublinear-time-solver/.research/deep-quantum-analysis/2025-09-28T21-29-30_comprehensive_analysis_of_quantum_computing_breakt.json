      "snippet": "# Meet Willow, our state-of-the-art quantum chip\n\n*Last updated: June 12, 2025*\n\nToday I’m delighted to announce Willow, our latest quantum chip. Willow has state-of-the-art performance across a number of metrics, enabling two major achievements.\n\n- The first is that Willow can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up using\n\n*more*qubits. This cracks a key challenge in quantum error correction that the field has pursued for almost 30 years.\n\n- Second, Willow performed a standard benchmark computation in under five minutes that would take one of today’s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion (that is, 10\n\n25) years — a number that vastly exceeds the age of the Universe.\n\nThe Willow chip is a major step on a journey that began over 10 years ago. When I founded Google Quantum AI in 2012, the vision was to build a useful, large-scale quantum computer that could harness quantum mechanics — the “operating system” of nature to the extent we know it today — to benefit society by advancing scientific discovery, developing helpful applications, and tackling some of society's greatest challenges. As part of Google Research, our team has charted a long-term roadmap, and Willow moves us significantly along that path towards commercially relevant applications.... ## Exponential quantum error correction — below threshold!\n\nErrors are one of the greatest challenges in quantum computing, since qubits, the units of computation in quantum computers, have a tendency to rapidly exchange information with their environment, making it difficult to protect the information needed to complete a computation. Typically the more qubits you use, the more errors will occur, and the system becomes classical.\n\nToday in Nature, we published results showing that\n\n**the more qubits we use in Willow, the more we** *reduce* ** errors** **, and the more quantum the system becomes**. We tested ever-larger arrays of physical qubits, scaling up from a grid of 3x3 encoded qubits, to a grid of 5x5, to a grid of 7x7 — and each time, using our latest advances in quantum error correction, we were able to cut the error rate in half. In other words, we achieved an exponential reduction in the error rate. This historic accomplishment is known in the field as “below threshold” — being able to drive errors down while scaling up the number of qubits. You must demonstrate being below threshold to show real progress on error correction, and this has been an outstanding challenge since quantum error correction was introduced by Peter Shor in 1995.\n\nThere are other scientific “firsts” involved in this result as well. For example, it’s also one of the first compelling examples of real-time error correction on a superconducting quantum system — crucial for any useful computation, because if you can’t correct errors fast enough, they ruin your computation before it’s done. And it’s a \"beyond breakeven\" demonstration, where our arrays of qubits have longer lifetimes than the individual physical qubits do, an unfakable sign that error correction is improving the system overall.\n\nAs the first system below threshold, this is the most convincing prototype for a scalable logical qubit built to date. It’s a strong sign that useful, very large quantum computers can indeed be built. Willow brings us closer to running practical, commercially-relevant algorithms that can’t be replicated on conventional computers.... ## 10 septillion years on one of today’s fastest supercomputers\n\nAs a measure of Willow’s performance, we used the random circuit sampling (RCS) benchmark. Pioneered by our team and now widely used as a standard in the field, RCS is the classically hardest benchmark that can be done on a quantum computer today. You can think of this as an entry point for quantum computing — it checks whether a quantum computer is doing something that couldn’t be done on a classical computer. Any team building a quantum computer should check first if it can beat classical computers on RCS; otherwise there is strong reason for skepticism that it can tackle more complex quantum tasks. We’ve consistently used this benchmark to assess progress from one generation of chip to the next — we reported Sycamore results in October 2019 and again recently in October 2024.\n\nWillow’s performance on this benchmark is astonishing: It performed a computation in under five minutes that would take one of today’s fastest supercomputers 10\n\n25 or 10 septillion years. If you want to write it out, it’s 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years. This mind-boggling number exceeds known timescales in physics and vastly exceeds the age of the universe. It lends credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes, in line with the idea that we live in a multiverse, a prediction first made by David Deutsch.\n\nThese latest results for Willow, as shown in the plot below, are our best so far, but we’ll continue to make progress.\n\nComputational costs are heavily influenced by available memory. Our estimates therefore consider a range of scenarios, from an ideal situation with unlimited memory (▲) to a more practical, embarrassingly parallelizable implementation on GPUs (⬤).\n\nOur assessment of how Willow outpaces one of the world’s most powerful classical supercomputers, Frontier, was based on conservative assumptions. For example, we assumed full access to secondary storage, i.e., hard drives, without any bandwidth overhead — a generous and unrealistic allowance for Frontier. Of course, as happened after we announced the first beyond-classical computation in 2019, we expect classical computers to keep improving on this benchmark, but the rapidly growing gap shows that quantum processors are peeling away at a double exponential rate and will continue to vastly outperform classical computers as we scale up.... ## State-of-the-art performance\n\nWillow was fabricated in our new, state-of-the-art fabrication facility in Santa Barbara — one of only a few facilities in the world built from the ground up for this purpose. System engineering is key when designing and fabricating quantum chips: All components of a chip, such as single and two-qubit gates, qubit reset, and readout, have to be simultaneously well engineered and integrated. If any component lags or if two components don't function well together, it drags down system performance. Therefore, maximizing system performance informs all aspects of our process, from chip architecture and fabrication to gate development and calibration. The achievements we report assess quantum computing systems holistically, not just one factor at a time.\n\nWe’re focusing on quality, not just quantity — because just producing larger numbers of qubits doesn’t help if they’re not high enough quality. With 105 qubits, Willow now has best-in-class performance across the two system benchmarks discussed above: quantum error correction and random circuit sampling. Such algorithmic benchmarks are the best way to measure overall chip performance. Other more specific performance metrics are also important; for example, our T\n\n1 times, which measure how long qubits can retain an excitation — the key quantum computational resource — are now approaching 100 µs (microseconds). This is an impressive ~5x improvement over our previous generation of chips. If you want to evaluate quantum hardware and compare across platforms, here is a table of key specifications:\n\nWillow’s performance across a number of metrics.... ## What’s next with Willow and beyond\n\nThe next challenge for the field is to demonstrate a first \"useful, beyond-classical\" computation on today's quantum chips that is relevant to a real-world application. We’re optimistic that the Willow generation of chips can help us achieve this goal. So far, there have been two separate types of experiments. On the one hand, we’ve run the RCS benchmark, which measures performance against classical computers but has no known real-world applications. On the other hand, we’ve done scientifically interesting simulations of quantum systems, which have led to new scientific discoveries but are still within the reach of classical computers. Our goal is to do both at the same time — to step into the realm of algorithms that are beyond the reach of classical computers\n\n**and** that are useful for real-world, commercially relevant problems.\n\nRandom circuit sampling (RCS), while extremely challenging for classical computers, has yet to demonstrate practical commercial applications.\n\nWe invite researchers, engineers, and developers to join us on this journey by checking out our open source software and educational resources, including our new course on Coursera, where developers can learn the essentials of quantum error correction and help us create algorithms that can solve the problems of the future.\n\nMy colleagues sometimes ask me why I left the burgeoning field of AI to focus on quantum computing. My answer is that both will prove to be the most transformational technologies of our time, but advanced AI will significantly benefit from access to quantum computing. This is why I named our lab Quantum AI. Quantum algorithms have fundamental scaling laws on their side, as we’re seeing with RCS. There are similar scaling advantages for many foundational computational tasks that are essential for AI. So quantum computation will be indispensable for collecting training data that’s inaccessible to classical machines, training and optimizing certain learning architectures, and modeling systems where quantum effects are important. This includes helping us discover new medicines, designing more efficient batteries for electric cars, and accelerating progress in fusion and new energy alternatives. Many of these future game-changing applications won’t be feasible on classical computers; they’re waiting to be unlocked with quantum computing."

They shift and change with the problems they're tasked to solve.\n{ts:11} Exploring a vast array\nof options all at once. And like nature, quantum\ncomputing is responsive to the environments it works within,\n{ts:21} leading us to new breakthroughs for tomorrow's most challenging problems. Introducing our latest\nquantum computing chip,\n{ts:31} developed to learn and evolve like the natural world around us. Willow from Google Quantum AI.\n{ts:40} - Hi, I'm Julian Kelly, Director of Hardware at Google Quantum AI. And today, on behalf of our amazing team,\n{ts:49} I'm proud to announce Willow. Willow is Google's newest and most powerful superconducting\nquantum computing chip,\n{ts:56} and the next step in our path towards building large-scale\nquantum computers and exploring your applications.\n{ts:63} I have been fascinated\nwith quantum computing since I first experimented\nwith qubits in 2008. And since coming to Google in 2015,\n{ts:70} it has been a dream to... make our mission a reality, building quantum computers for otherwise unsolvable problems.\n{ts:79} We launched our first\nchip Foxtail in 2017, followed by Bristlecone in\n2018 and Sycamore in 2019, which powered our milestone one,\n{ts:90} the first quantum computer to surpass the best\nclassical supercomputer on a computational task,\nrandom circuit sampling.\n{ts:98} Over the years with Sycamore, we have been able to squeeze a remarkable amount of\nperformance from our hardware,\n{ts:104} including achieving a\nscalable logical qubit in our milestone two. But we've ultimately been limited\n{ts:111} by quantum coherence times, the length of time qubits\nmaintain their intended state. With Willow, we've made\na huge step forward.\n{ts:120} We've increased quantum coherence times by a factor of 5, going from 20 microseconds in Sycamore\n{ts:126} to 100 microseconds in Willow, and we've accomplished this all without sacrificing any of the features\n{ts:133} that made our systems so successful. This advancement was enabled by our new dedicated\nsuperconducting quantum chip\n{ts:141} fabrication facility in Santa Barbara, one of only a few in the world. And we... 're seeing exciting\ndevelopments coming from Willow,\n{ts:149} which has already surpassed Sycamore's breakthrough demonstrations. Our logical qubits now operate\n{ts:156} below the critical quantum\nerror correction threshold, a long sought-after goal for\nthe quantum computing field since the theory was\ndiscovered in the '90s,\n{ts:167} and we've achieved it for\nthe first time with Willow. Errors are exponentially\nsuppressed in our logical qubits as error rates are halved each\ntime we add physical qubits\n{ts:176} and scale from distance 3\nto 5 to 7 surface codes. Additionally, our logical qubit lifetimes are now much longer than\nall of the lifetimes\n{ts:187} of the physical qubits that compose them. This means that even as\nwe make our quantum chips larger and more complex\nby adding more cubits,\n{ts:195} we can use quantum error correction to actually improve their accuracy. We've pitted Willow\n{ts:201} against one of the world's\nmost powerful supercomputers with the random circuit\nsampling benchmark. The results are pretty surprising.\n{ts:210} By our best estimates, a calculation that takes... Willow under 5 minutes would take the fastest\nsupercomputer 10 to the 25 years.\n{ts:221} That's a 1 with 25 zeros following it, or a timescale way longer\nthan the age of the universe. This result highlights the\nexponentially growing gap\n{ts:232} between classical and quantum computation for certain applications. Let's talk about the hardware approach\n{ts:239} we've pioneered at Google Quantum AI that makes these things possible. Our tuneable qubits and couplers\n{ts:246} enable super fast gates and operations to achieve low error rates, reconfigurability to\noptimize hardware in situ\n{ts:254} and run multiple applications and high connectivity to\nefficiently express algorithms. We leverage this tunability\n{ts:262} to enable reproducible high\nperformance across the device. Let me explain. A challenge in superconducting qubits is\n{ts:270} that not all of them are created equal. Some are outliers with\nuncharacteristically high errors, but here's where our\ntunable cubits really shine.\n{ts:280} We're able to fix these outlier qubits by reconfiguring them to perform in line with the rest of the device.... {ts:286} And we can go one step further by having our researchers use tunability to continuously develop\nnew calibration strategies\n{ts:292} that push errors down across\nall qubits with software. Let's quantify this and\nnerd out for a minute on a quantum computer text specs.\n{ts:303} We have number of qubits. Connectivity is the average\nnumber of interactions each qubit can perform with its neighbors.\n{ts:312} We quantify error probabilities for running simultaneous operations. Single qubit gates, two\nqubit gates, and measurement.\n{ts:320} Coherence time measures\nhow long each qubit can retain its information. Measurement rate is\n{ts:325} how many computations\nwe can run per second. An application performance\nis a full system benchmark. Willow hits a sweet spot\nacross the full list.\n{ts:337} It has a large number of\nqubits with high connectivity and can run diverse applications. We measure low mean error\nrates across all operations\n{ts:346} with multiple native two qubit gates. We have greatly increased T1 times, we have very high measurement rates,\n{ts:354} and Willow is below the\nerror correction threshold and performs random circuit sampling far beyond what is possible... with classical computers.\n{ts:363} Looking to the future with Willow, we continue our journey\ntowards building large scale and useful error-corrected\nquantum computers\n{ts:371} that will push the boundaries of science and the exploration of nature. With future commercially\nuseful applications\n{ts:377} in areas like pharmaceuticals,\nbatteries, and fusion power, we are excited to solve the otherwise unsolvable\nproblems of tomorrow.\n{ts:389} (inspiring music)"
